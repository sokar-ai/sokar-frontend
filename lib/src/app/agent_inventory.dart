/// An agent is installed separately from the thing that runs it, so *what is here* is a real
/// question with a real answer, and the answer is different on every machine. Nothing in this
/// interface names a specific agent: the list is discovered, always.
///
/// **The ones that failed to describe themselves are part of the answer.** An agent that cannot
/// say what it is is installed and unusable, and leaving it out would read as not installed —
/// which is the state somebody would not go looking for.
///
/// **`Agents` answers one entry per name.** They are held in a map keyed by name on the daemon
/// side, so two copies of one name never arrive here. Shadowing is resolved before anything is
/// listed — first location wins, most specific first — and the losers come back in their own
/// list, each naming the copy that runs instead.
