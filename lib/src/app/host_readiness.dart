/// **The question nobody could ask before.** Every dependency this reports fails far from its
/// cause — without `nft` a container comes up with no ruleset, without `git` the gate has no
/// mirror, without `nsenter` a clearance decision cannot reach a running task. Until this was on
/// the wire, a person learned about them by starting work and watching it behave strangely.
///
/// **Nothing here offers to fix anything, and that is a decision rather than a gap.** Preparing a
/// machine means installing packages and writing under `/etc` — root on the node, and exactly the
/// powers this product is built around not having. There is a second reason it could never have
/// worked from here: a machine that is not ready usually has no daemon to ask, so a check
/// delivered over the daemon's socket can only ever answer for a machine whose daemon is already
/// up. What this shows instead is the single next action, which the daemon already names.
