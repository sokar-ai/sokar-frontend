The desktop interface for [Sokar](https://github.com/sokar-ai/sokar), on Linux.

Sokar runs AI coding agents in locked-down containers: no network except what a project declares, no
credential the agent can read, and nothing leaves the machine without somebody approving it. This
interface does what Sokar's command line does, on this computer and on machines reached over ssh,
without a terminal.

**Documentation: [sokar-ai.github.io/frontend](https://sokar-ai.github.io/frontend/)**, the interface's chapter of all of Sokar's documentation.
