# Frontend Requirements

The interface people use to work with a Sokar backend, as what must be true for a person using it.
One file per requirement, `F<nn>-Short-Title.md`, each with its acceptance criteria; the number is
identity, not order. Everything is built against `org.fuin.sokar.Tasks1` over the daemon's socket:
[Design](../doc/design.md) says what the interface is made of, [Backend API](../doc/Backend-API.md)
how it talks to a daemon, and [what the contract does not yet cover](../doc/Contract-Gaps.md) what
the backend has no method or field for yet.

**Now** serves the MVP: one person, one machine, one agent, from installing Sokar to reviewed work
pushed, all from the interface, for someone who has never used Sokar. **Soon** follows right after
it, **Later** is the rest. Each table is in the order to do the work; **Open questions** counts the
issue's *To be checked*. A finished issue is deleted, file and row together, once what outlives it
is in `doc/` or `AGENTS.md`; decisions are in [doc/decisions.md](../doc/decisions.md).
