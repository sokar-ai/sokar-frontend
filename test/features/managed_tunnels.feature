Feature: Raising and dropping the forward that reaches a machine

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work

  Scenario: a machine is described by where it is, and the forward is raised here
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    Then the forward was raised for {'the build machine'}
    And the machine {'the build machine'} says the forward is raised here

  Scenario: how it is reached is chosen, never assumed
    When I open the machine dialog
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    Then watching it is not offered yet

  Scenario: a machine whose socket is already forwarded has nothing raised for it
    When I watch another machine called {'elsewhere'}
    Then nothing was raised for {'elsewhere'}
    And the machine {'elsewhere'} does not say the forward is raised here

  Scenario: a forward that cannot be raised says what the transport said
    Given raising a forward will fail with {'Host key verification failed.'}
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    Then the machine {'the build machine'} says {'Host key verification failed.'}

  # A machine that answered yesterday and does not today is usually a daemon nobody started.
  Scenario: a watched machine that is silent can be started from its menu, once somebody agrees
    Given nothing answers on that machine
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    And I switch to the machine {'the build machine'}
    And I ask to start Sokar on this machine
    Then nothing was started on that machine
    When I agree to start it
    Then the machine was asked to start {'setsid sokard'}
    And the session recorded {'Start Sokar on user@build.example.test'}
    And the machine {'the build machine'} answers again

  Scenario: a start nobody agreed to runs nothing
    Given nothing answers on that machine
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    And I switch to the machine {'the build machine'}
    And I ask to start Sokar on this machine
    And I do not agree to start it
    Then nothing was started on that machine
    When the machine can answer again
    Then the machine {'the build machine'} answers again

  Scenario: a machine that answers is offered no start at all
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    And I switch to the machine {'the build machine'}
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Start Sokar on this machine'} is unavailable because {'already answering'}

  Scenario: a machine somebody else forwards is offered no start, because there is no host
    When I watch another machine called {'elsewhere'}
    And I switch to the machine {'elsewhere'}
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Start Sokar on this machine'} is unavailable because {'somebody else'}

  # Stopping is the other half of starting: a console can do it, so the interface can too. Since the
  # tasks run on without their daemon, what it costs is the watching and the questions nobody answers.
  Scenario: a machine that answers can be stopped from its menu, told first what stopping costs
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    And I switch to the machine {'the build machine'}
    And I ask to stop Sokar on this machine
    Then it says {'What runs there goes on running'}
    And it says {'nothing here watches it'}
    And it says {'goes unanswered and runs out'}
    And nothing was stopped on that machine
    When I agree to stop it
    Then the machine was asked to stop {'systemctl --user stop sokard'}
    And the session recorded {'Stop Sokar on user@build.example.test'}
    And the machine {'the build machine'} no longer answers
    When I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Start Sokar on this machine'} is offered
    When the machine can answer again
    Then the machine {'the build machine'} answers again

  Scenario: a stop nobody agreed to runs nothing
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    And I switch to the machine {'the build machine'}
    And I ask to stop Sokar on this machine
    And I do not agree to stop it
    Then nothing was stopped on that machine
    And the machine {'the build machine'} answers again

  Scenario: a machine that is not answering is offered no stop
    Given nothing answers on that machine
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    And I switch to the machine {'the build machine'}
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Stop Sokar on this machine'} is unavailable because {'not answering'}
    When the machine can answer again
    Then the machine {'the build machine'} answers again

  Scenario: a machine somebody else forwards is offered no stop, because there is no host
    When I watch another machine called {'elsewhere'}
    And I switch to the machine {'elsewhere'}
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Stop Sokar on this machine'} is unavailable because {'somebody else'}

  Scenario: closing the interface leaves no forward it raised still running
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    And I close the interface
    Then no forward this interface raised is still running

  Scenario: a forward the interface did not raise is never torn down by it
    When I watch another machine called {'elsewhere'}
    And I close the interface
    Then nothing was torn down for {'elsewhere'}

  Scenario: the socket on the other machine is asked for, never guessed
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    Then its socket there is not filled in

  # A person new to Sokar knows how they log in, not a uid: left empty, the machine is asked.
  Scenario: a socket left empty is asked of the machine when it is watched, and the forward goes there
    Given the account logs in as uid {1007}
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And I watch it
    Then the machine was asked who {'user@build.example.test'} logs in as
    And the forward was raised through {'user@build.example.test'} to {'/run/user/1007/sokar/sokard.sock'}

  # What setting a machine up wrote on this computer is offered for removal when it is forgotten, and
  # only offered: the Host entry in exactly the form the wizard writes, and its key unless another
  # entry uses it.
  Scenario: forgetting a machine the wizard set up offers its Host entry and key, and removes neither unasked
    Given the wizard set up the machine {'build'}
    And I switch to the machine {'build'}
    When I ask to forget this machine
    Then it says {'Also remove Host sokar-build from ~/.ssh/config'}
    And it says {'Also delete its key'}
    When I forget it
    Then the ssh config still has the Host {'sokar-build'}
    And the key of {'build'} is still there

  Scenario: forgetting a machine the wizard set up removes its Host entry and key when asked
    Given the wizard set up the machine {'build'}
    And I switch to the machine {'build'}
    When I ask to forget this machine
    And I also remove its Host entry
    And I also delete its key
    And I forget it
    Then the ssh config no longer has the Host {'sokar-build'}
    And the ssh config as it was before is kept
    And the key of {'build'} is gone

  Scenario: a key another Host entry uses is not offered for deleting
    Given the wizard set up the machine {'build'}
    And another Host entry uses the key of {'build'}
    And I switch to the machine {'build'}
    When I ask to forget this machine
    Then it says {'Another entry in ~/.ssh/config uses it, so it stays.'}
    And deleting its key cannot be chosen

  Scenario: a Host entry written by hand is never offered for removal
    Given the machine {'handmade'} is reached through a Host entry written by hand
    And I switch to the machine {'handmade'}
    When I ask to forget this machine
    Then the ssh config still has the Host {'handmade'}
    And the machine {'handmade'} is no longer watched
