Feature: Checking whether a machine can run work at all

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running

  Scenario: whether this machine can run anything is one action away
    When I check whether this machine can run anything
    Then it says {'This machine can run work. Nothing is missing.'}

  # Every one of these fails far from its cause. Until it was on the wire, somebody learned about
  # them by starting work and watching it behave strangely.
  Scenario: something missing is named, with what to do about it
    Given the machine is missing {'nft'} because {'no nftables binary on PATH'}
    When I check whether this machine can run anything
    Then it says {'This machine cannot run work: one thing it needs is missing.'}
    And it says {'no nftables binary on PATH'}
    And it says {'install nftables'}

  # DEGRADED and UNKNOWN leave a machine running tasks. Rounding either up to "fine" hides the
  # thing somebody would want to know before wondering why a run behaved oddly.
  Scenario: a machine that runs work with something worth knowing is not called fine
    Given the machine is degraded at {'rootless network backend'} because {'slirp4netns rather than pasta'}
    When I check whether this machine can run anything
    Then it says {'This machine runs work. One thing is worth knowing about.'}
    And it says {'slirp4netns rather than pasta'}

  # Its own answer rather than the good case: a probe that guesses well is indistinguishable from
  # one that works.
  Scenario: a check that could not be established says so rather than passing
    Given the machine cannot establish {'SELinux policy'}
    When I check whether this machine can run anything
    Then it says {'could not be established'}
    And it says {'This machine runs work. One thing is worth knowing about.'}

  Scenario: the same check can be run again on demand
    When I check whether this machine can run anything
    And I check the machine again
    Then the machine was asked twice whether it can run anything

  # Preparing a machine means installing packages and writing under /etc, which is root on the
  # node — and a machine that is not ready usually has no daemon to ask in the first place.
  Scenario: nothing here offers to fix the machine, and says so
    When I check whether this machine can run anything
    Then it says {'Nothing here installs or configures anything'}

  Scenario: a daemon too old to answer says so rather than showing a machine with nothing wrong
    Given the machine cannot answer whether it can run anything
    When I check whether this machine can run anything
    Then it says {'this backend has no Doctor'}
