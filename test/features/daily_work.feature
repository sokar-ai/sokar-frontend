# The Feature line is the report row: one short sentence, 70 characters at most,
# saying what this file tests. It is the group name in every surface CI renders.
Feature: Daily work in front, setting up machines and projects apart

  # The operator's decision: machines (where work runs) and projects (how it runs) are set up
  # rarely; the daily view is the work, what needs a person, and starting new work.
  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running

  Scenario: the window opens on the work of every machine, what waits for a person first
    Then the section shown is {'Work'}
    And the work {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} is in the group {'waiting'}
    And the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'} is in the group {'running'}
    And the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} is in the group {'running'}

  # Walk 9, the operator: stopped work is rarely what a person looks for, so its group starts shut.
  Scenario: stopped work is shown apart, its group shut until opened
    Given the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} has stopped
    Then the group {'stopped'} is shut {true}
    When I open the group {'stopped'}
    Then the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} is in the group {'stopped'}

  # Walk 9, the operator: a tile is its work, its machine and its mark; the rest when opened.
  Scenario: a tile on the work page is folded to its work and machine, and opened for the rest
    Then the tile {'sokar-billing-shell'} is folded {true}
    When I open the tile {'sokar-billing-shell'}
    Then the tile {'sokar-billing-shell'} is folded {false}

  Scenario: a tile that asks something of a person is never folded
    Then the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} is folded {false}

  # Walk 9, the operator: within each group, the work active last comes first.
  Scenario: the work in a group is in the order of its last activity, newest first
    Given the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} has been in its state since {'2026-10-03T08:00:00Z'}
    And the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has been in its state since {'2026-10-01T08:00:00Z'}
    Then the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} comes before {'sokar-checkout-shell'}

  Scenario: the work is narrowed to one project, and widened back
    When I narrow the work to the project {'billing'}
    Then no tile is shown for {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} is in the group {'running'}
    When I narrow the work to every project
    Then the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'} is in the group {'running'}

  Scenario: new work asks in which project, and opens the start for it
    When I start new work
    And I choose the project {'billing'} for it
    Then it says {'Start work in billing'}

  Scenario: new work can be in no project
    When I start new work
    And I choose no project for it
    Then it says {'Start work without a project'}

  Scenario: machines are a page of setting up, each with its projects under it
    When I go to the place {'machines'}
    Then the section shown is {'Machines'}
    And the project {'checkout'} is listed
    And the project {'billing'} is listed

  Scenario: projects are a page of setting up, each opened on its machine
    When I go to the place {'projects'}
    Then the projects page lists {'checkout'} on {'this machine'}
    When I open {'billing'} on {'this machine'} from the projects page
    Then the project {'billing'} is the one shown

  # The operator: work of one project on two machines cannot share its conversation through each
  # machine's own homeserver, and a person starting it there is told before, not after.
  Scenario: starting work of a project that runs on another machine says they cannot talk
    Given the project {'checkout'} has a conversation over {'matrix'} reaching {'127.0.0.1:8008'}, ready
    And the machine {'elsewhere'} runs work of {'checkout'}
    When I start new work on {'this machine'} in {'checkout'}
    Then it says {'Work of checkout runs on elsewhere already'}
    And it says {'only through a central Matrix server, and this project names none'}

  Scenario: a project on a central server is said not to be joined by a second machine yet
    Given the project {'checkout'} has a conversation over {'matrix'} reaching {'https://matrix.example.org'}, ready
    And the machine {'elsewhere'} runs work of {'checkout'}
    When I start new work on {'this machine'} in {'checkout'}
    Then it says {'a second machine cannot join it yet'}

  Scenario: a project without a conversation says nothing about another machine
    Given the machine {'elsewhere'} runs work of {'checkout'}
    When I start new work on {'this machine'} in {'checkout'}
    Then it does not say {'runs on elsewhere already'}

  # What a tile's action answered was said only on the machine's page, and from the work page an
  # action seemed to do nothing (found running the leased machine's leg against the new window).
  Scenario: what an action from a tile answers is said on the work page
    When I choose {'Write to its agent'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    And I put {'the schema changed'} in its inbox
    Then the section shown is {'Work'}
    And the status line mentions {'Written into the inbox of sokar-checkout-migrate'}

  Scenario: the order follows the last activity, whichever work it was
    Given the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has been in its state since {'2026-10-03T08:00:00Z'}
    And the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} has been in its state since {'2026-10-01T08:00:00Z'}
    Then the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'} comes before {'sokar-billing-shell'}

  # Walk 9, the operator: "Stopped (10)" stayed at 10 after he removed one.
  Scenario: removing stopped work counts it out of its group
    Given the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} has stopped
    And the work {'sokar-billing-audit'} has stopped
    When I open the group {'stopped'}
    Then it says {'Stopped (2)'}
    When I choose {'Remove it'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-billing-shell'}
    And I press {'Remove it'}
    Then it says {'Stopped (1)'}

  # Walk 9, the operator: a removal the machine refused was said only in the status line of the
  # work page, and "nothing happens" was what he saw.
  Scenario: a removal the machine refuses is put in front of the person on the work page
    Given the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} has stopped
    And removing will refuse because the work is held
    When I open the group {'stopped'}
    And I choose {'Remove it'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-billing-shell'}
    And I press {'Remove it'}
    Then what is held is shown
    # Walk 9, the operator: the group he had opened was shut again once the refusal was decided.
    When I choose {'Leave it alone'}
    Then the group {'stopped'} is shut {false}

  # Walk 9, the operator: Machines is a list of machines, each with details of its own; its projects
  # are under Projects and its work under Work, never on a machine's or a project's page.
  Scenario: machines are a list, and a machine's details show no projects and no work
    Then the machines page lists only machines
    When I open the details of {'this machine'}
    Then the title is {'this machine'}
    And no work is shown on this page

  Scenario: a project's page shows no work, and leads to its work on the work page
    When I select the project {'billing'}
    Then the title is {'this machine › billing'}
    And no work is shown on this page
    When I go to its work
    Then the section shown is {'Work'}
    And no tile is shown for {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} is in the group {'running'}

  # Walk 9, the operator: removing a machine from the list sent the window to Needs you.
  Scenario: removing a machine from the list stays on the list
    When I watch another machine called {'elsewhere'}
    And I remove {'elsewhere'} from the list of machines
    Then the section shown is {'Machines'}
    And the machine {'elsewhere'} is listed {false}

  Scenario: a project's page whose project went goes back to the list of projects
    When I select the project {'billing'}
    And the machine no longer has the project {'billing'}
    Then the section shown is {'Projects'}

  # Walk 9, the operator: this computer itself is never removed from the list.
  Scenario: this computer cannot be removed from the list of machines, another can
    When I watch another machine called {'elsewhere'}
    Then the machine {'this machine'} can be removed from the list {false}
    And the machine {'elsewhere'} can be removed from the list {true}

  # Walk 9, the operator: a project's commands are on its row, as a tile's are on the tile.
  Scenario: a project's row carries its menu, and its page the points to change it
    When I go to the place {'projects'}
    And I choose {'Stop telling me about this project'} from the menu of the project {'checkout'}
    Then the project {'checkout'} is marked as silent
    When I select the project {'checkout'}
    Then the project's page offers {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the project's page offers {'What this project may reach'}

  Scenario: a project's page shows the project, not a bar of its machine
    When I select the project {'billing'}
    Then the machine's bar is shown {false}
    When I open the details of {'this machine'}
    Then the machine's bar is shown {true}

  # Walk 9, the operator: Projects is the view of what projects there are. A project is one, on however
  # many machines, and so is Default; its page chooses which machine it shows.
  Scenario: a project on two machines is listed once, saying both, and its page chooses between them
    Given the machine {'elsewhere'} runs work of {'checkout'}
    When I go to the place {'projects'}
    Then the card of {'checkout'} lists the machines {'this machine, elsewhere'}
    When I open {'checkout'} on {'elsewhere'} from the projects page
    Then the title is {'elsewhere › checkout'}
