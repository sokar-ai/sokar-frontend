Feature: A project's conversation, and a person joining it

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}

  Scenario: a project with no conversation is not offered its messages
    When I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Messages — the conversation of this project, and who has joined it'} is unavailable because {'checkout has no conversation'}

  Scenario: where the conversation is, and whether this machine can carry it, is said
    Given the project {'checkout'} has a conversation over {'matrix'} reaching {'127.0.0.1:8008'}, not ready saying {'the homeserver does not answer'}
    When I choose the command {'Messages — the conversation of this project, and who has joined it'}
    Then it says {'Over matrix, reaching 127.0.0.1:8008.'}
    And it says {'This machine cannot carry its messages now: the homeserver does not answer'}
    And it says {'Nobody has joined yet.'}

  # Answered once and kept nowhere: shown whole while the dialog is open, and gone with it.
  Scenario: a person joins, and their login is shown once with the homeserver forwarded here
    Given the machine is reached over ssh as {'michi@vm'}
    And the project {'checkout'} has a conversation over {'matrix'} reaching {'127.0.0.1:8008'}, ready
    And I select the project {'checkout'}
    When I choose the command {'Messages — the conversation of this project, and who has joined it'}
    And I join {'anna'}
    Then the machine was asked to let {'anna'} join {'checkout'}
    And it says {'pw-1-once'}
    And what a walk writes down does not hold {'pw-1-once'}
    And the {'login password'} is blanked in a walk's picture
    And it says {'#sokar-checkout:localhost'}
    And it says {'Matrix ID'}
    And it says {'Homeserver URL'}
    And it says {'anna, as @anna:localhost'}
    And a forward of port {'8008'} is held
    And it says {'port 8008 is forwarded from this computer while this window runs'}
    # Walk 10: nheko lost its server when the dialog closed. Kept while the window runs.
    When I am done with the messages
    Then the forward of port {'8008'} is still held
    When I choose the command {'Messages — the conversation of this project, and who has joined it'}
    Then it says {'A Matrix client here reaches its homeserver at http://127.0.0.1:8008, forwarded while this window runs.'}

  # Walk 10: where the address is said beside the dialog, and a forward that cannot be raised is not quiet.
  Scenario: the homeserver's address is said on the project's page, and a forward that cannot be raised needs you
    Given the machine is reached over ssh as {'michi@vm'}
    And the project {'checkout'} has a conversation over {'matrix'} reaching {'127.0.0.1:8008'}, ready
    And I select the project {'checkout'}
    When I choose the command {'Messages — the conversation of this project, and who has joined it'}
    And I join {'anna'}
    And I am done with the messages
    Then the project header says {'A Matrix client here reaches its homeserver at http://127.0.0.1:8008.'}
    Given the next forward is refused because {'Port 8008 is already in use on this computer.'}
    When the forward of port {'8008'} drops and is tried again
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then it says {'The homeserver of checkout on'}
    And it says {'Port 8008 is already in use on this computer.'}
    And it says {'Try again'}

  Scenario: a person who has joined already is offered a new password, and nothing else
    Given the project {'checkout'} has a conversation over {'matrix'} reaching {'127.0.0.1:8008'}, ready
    And {'anna'} has joined the conversation of {'checkout'}
    When I choose the command {'Messages — the conversation of this project, and who has joined it'}
    And I join {'anna'}
    Then it says {'anna has joined already, as @anna:localhost'}
    When I give a new password
    Then the machine was last asked to let {'anna'} join {'checkout'} with a new password
    And it says {'pw-2-once'}

  # This computer's loopback is the machine's: nothing to forward.
  Scenario: a machine that is this computer forwards nothing for its homeserver
    Given the project {'checkout'} has a conversation over {'matrix'} reaching {'127.0.0.1:8008'}, ready
    When I choose the command {'Messages — the conversation of this project, and who has joined it'}
    And I join {'anna'}
    Then it says {'The homeserver is on this computer, at http://127.0.0.1:8008.'}
    And nothing was forwarded

  Scenario: nobody is joined without a name
    Given the project {'checkout'} has a conversation over {'matrix'} reaching {'127.0.0.1:8008'}, ready
    When I choose the command {'Messages — the conversation of this project, and who has joined it'}
    Then joining is not offered yet
