Feature: Stopping everything on a machine, and naming what survives

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running

  Scenario: the way to stop everything is on screen without opening anything
    Then stopping everything is offered on the frame

  Scenario: it is reachable by name as well
    When I open the command finder
    Then the command finder names {'Stop everything on this machine'}

  Scenario: it never stops anything on the first press
    When I ask to stop everything
    Then nothing has been stopped
    And it says {'This would stop the 3 pieces of work that are running'}

  Scenario: leaving is the default, so a stray Return carries nothing
    When I ask to stop everything
    Then leaving it running is the default

  Scenario: agreeing stops everything and says what state the machine is in
    When I ask to stop everything
    And I agree to stop everything
    Then it says {'Stopped the 3 that were running. Nothing was removed.'}
    And it says {'exactly where it was'}

  Scenario: the way back is named, not left to be worked out
    When I ask to stop everything
    And I agree to stop everything
    Then it says how to get back to work

  Scenario: a helper that outlived its stop is named, never counted
    Given one helper will outlive the stop
    When I ask to stop everything
    And I agree to stop everything
    Then it names the helper {'sokar-checkout-shell-gate (pid 4711)'}
    And it says {'killed on the machine by hand'}

  Scenario: losing the machine mid-stop says nothing was stopped
    Given the backend will refuse to stop everything
    When I ask to stop everything
    And I agree to stop everything
    Then it says {'Nothing was stopped, and work is still running'}

  Scenario: what was stopped is named, because the name is how it comes back
    When I ask to stop everything
    And I agree to stop everything
    Then it names the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'} among what was stopped

  Scenario: a preview promises nothing about what will survive
    When I ask to stop everything
    Then it does not claim everything will stop cleanly
