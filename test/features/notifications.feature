Feature: Telling somebody who is not looking at the window

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}

  Scenario: a waiting decision reaches somebody who is not looking at the window
    When work is blocked reaching {'api.example.test:443'}
    Then somebody is told {'is asking to reach api.example.test:443'}
    And it was told as something that cannot wait

  # Every machine is watched from the moment it is added, not only those there at the start.
  Scenario: a question on a machine added later reaches somebody too
    When I watch another machine called {'elsewhere'}
    And work elsewhere is blocked reaching {'api.example.test:443'}
    Then somebody is told {'is asking to reach api.example.test:443'}

  Scenario: the same question is never raised twice
    When work is blocked reaching {'api.example.test:443'}
    And work is blocked reaching {'api.example.test:443'}
    Then somebody was told exactly {'1'} time

  Scenario: finishing is told apart from failing
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation finishes
    Then somebody is told {'That is done'}
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation fails
    Then somebody is told {'That did not work'}

  Scenario: acting on it opens the work it came from
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation finishes
    And I close what is open
    And somebody acts on what they were told
    Then the operation is open

  Scenario: a project that has been turned off says nothing
    When I select the project {'checkout'}
    And I stop being told about this project
    And work is blocked reaching {'api.example.test:443'}
    Then nobody was told anything

  Scenario: a project that is turned off says so where it is listed
    When I select the project {'checkout'}
    And I stop being told about this project
    Then the project {'checkout'} is marked as silent

  Scenario: turning a project off does not silence the others
    When I select the project {'checkout'}
    And I stop being told about this project
    And work in {'billing'} is blocked reaching {'api.example.test:443'}
    Then somebody is told {'is asking to reach api.example.test:443'}
