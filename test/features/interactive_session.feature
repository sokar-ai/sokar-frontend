Feature: Working inside a container by hand, locally or over ssh

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'billing'}
    And I select the work {'sokar-billing-shell'}

  Scenario: a session is one action from where the work is listed
    When I work in it by hand
    Then the session runs {'sokar task attach sokar-billing-shell'}

  Scenario: a machine reached over ssh runs the same verb, through a terminal of its own
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    And I switch to the machine {'the build machine'}
    And I select the project {'billing'}
    And I select the work {'sokar-billing-shell'}
    And I work in it by hand
    Then the session runs {'ssh -t user@build.example.test sokar task attach sokar-billing-shell'}

  Scenario: what the far end prints is what is on the screen
    When I work in it by hand
    And the session prints {'root@sokar-billing-shell:/work#'}
    Then the session shows {'root@sokar-billing-shell:/work#'}

  Scenario: what is typed reaches the far end
    When I work in it by hand
    And I type {'ls -l'} into the session
    Then the session was sent {'ls -l'}

  # The same work that may not be widened, and deliberately so: the class governs egress — what
  # resolves and what leaves — and a person typing is neither. Offline is precisely the project
  # where somebody has to work by hand, because the agent reaches nothing.
  Scenario: an offline project may be worked in by hand, though it may not be widened
    When I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Let this work reach something new'} is offered as unavailable
    When I work in it by hand
    Then the session runs {'sokar task attach sokar-billing-shell'}

  # Refused here until 2026-09-08, on the strength of "the agent is the main process, so there is
  # no session to attach to". Wrong: `AGENT` and `SHELL` are the same task — same container, same
  # egress, same gate — and attaching starts its own multiplexer by `podman exec`, which does not
  # care what the main process is. The refusal took the action away from the commonest kind of
  # task there is.
  Scenario: work an agent is driving can be worked in by hand like any other
    Given I select the project {'checkout'}
    And I select the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    When I work in it by hand
    Then the session runs {'sokar task attach sokar-checkout-shell'}

  # Against work whose mode nothing recorded, deliberately: nothing else can take the action
  # away, so what is measured is the running check on its own. A scenario against a stopped
  # unattended run passed with that check deleted — the agent rule was doing the work.
  Scenario: work that has stopped has no session, and points at starting it again
    When I select the work {'sokar-billing-audit'}
    And the work {'sokar-billing-audit'} is dead
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Work in it by hand'} is unavailable because {'Starting it again brings back the workspace'}

  # Opened where it was asked for and kept there: going elsewhere and back finds it as it was.
  Scenario: a session stays where it was opened, and going elsewhere and back finds it there
    When I work in it by hand
    Then the session is on screen
    And the work pane is not shown
    When I go to what needs a person
    Then the session is not on screen
    When I go to the work
    Then the session is on screen

  Scenario: leaving a session puts somebody back where they were, with the same work selected
    When I work in it by hand
    And I leave the session
    Then the work {'sokar-billing-shell'} is still selected

  # Found by asking where the key went rather than by assuming: the frame's `Escape` closed the
  # pane and the far end never saw it, which would have made `vim` unusable inside a session.
  Scenario: Escape belongs to what is running, and never closes the session
    When I work in it by hand
    And I close what is open
    Then the session is on screen
    And {1} sessions are open

  # The operator's decision: one at a time. A second way in leaves the first; its work carries on.
  Scenario: opening a session elsewhere leaves the one that was open, and opens where it was asked
    When I work in it by hand
    And I show what is running
    And I work in {'sokar-billing-audit'} by hand from its tile
    Then {1} sessions are open
    And the session on screen is {'sokar-billing-audit'}
    And the first session was left
    And the work was never stopped
    When I select the project {'billing'}
    Then the session is not on screen

  # One container holds one session, so asking again returns to the one that is there. A second
  # way in to the same work would draw the same screen twice and let somebody type into either.
  Scenario: asking for the same session again returns to it, where it was asked for
    When I work in it by hand
    And I show what is running
    And I work in {'sokar-billing-shell'} by hand from its tile
    Then {1} sessions are open
    And only one terminal was ever opened
    And the session on screen is {'sokar-billing-shell'}

  Scenario: the screen says that closing the window leaves the session running
    When I work in it by hand
    Then it says {'Closing this window leaves the session running'}

  # The figure is Sokar's, pinned in the image rather than left to tmux's default, so coming back
  # can say what it shows instead of leaving somebody to guess whether a quiet hour is missing.
  Scenario: coming back says how much of the missed time it can show
    When I work in it by hand
    Then it says {'the last 10000 lines and no more'}

  Scenario: a session the machine would not open says so, without claiming the work stopped
    When I work in it by hand
    And the session ends with {69}
    Then it says {'The machine would not open a session here'}
    And the work was never stopped

  Scenario: a connection that never happened is told apart from work that refused
    When I start watching another machine
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    And I switch to the machine {'the build machine'}
    And I select the project {'billing'}
    And I select the work {'sokar-billing-shell'}
    And I work in it by hand
    And the session ends with {255}
    Then it says {'The connection to the build machine failed'}

  Scenario: leaving a session closes the way in and stops nothing
    When I work in it by hand
    And I leave the session
    Then no session is open
    And the work was never stopped

  Scenario: somebody who typed exit is not told that anything went wrong
    When I work in it by hand
    And the session ends with {0}
    Then it says {'This way in is closed. The work is where you left it.'}
