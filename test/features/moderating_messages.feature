# The Feature line is the report row: one short sentence, 70 characters at most,
# saying what this file tests. It is the group name in every surface CI renders.
Feature: Reading and deciding about what work says to other work

  # Asked of the machine, never gathered from the stream: Talk replays nothing, so a message held
  # before the interface started would otherwise be missing, and the view would say nothing waits.
  Scenario: a message held before the interface started is in what needs a person, and counted
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'please look at the diff'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then what needs a person shows a message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the count of what needs a person is {'1 need you'}

  Scenario: a message held while the interface watches arrives without asking
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    When {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} while I watch
    Then what needs a person shows a message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}

  # A message nobody has cleared is evidence, not content: nothing in it is rendered or followed.
  Scenario: a held message is read in full, as text, and nothing in it is interpreted
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'**now** [see](https://evil.example/x) <b>here</b>'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    When I read the message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    Then the message reads exactly {'**now** [see](https://evil.example/x) <b>here</b>'}
    And nothing in the message can be pressed
    And it says {'Held until somebody reads it'}

  # What was read is what is decided: the decision names the file that was on screen.
  Scenario: releasing a message names the message that was read
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'please look at the diff'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    When I read the message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And I release the message
    Then the machine was told to release {'msg-1.json'} of {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And it says {'Released. It goes out on the next pass, unless its peer is set to refuse everything.'}
    # Closed once decided (walk 8): the outcome is said in the window behind it.
    And the message is no longer open
    And what needs a person shows no message
    And nothing needs me

  Scenario: refusing a message refuses it for good
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'please look at the diff'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    When I read the message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And I refuse the message
    Then the machine was told to refuse {'msg-1.json'} of {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And it says {'Refused for good'}
    And it does not say {'with your words'}

  # A refusal with a person's own words hands them to the one that wrote it, so its agent knows why.
  Scenario: a refusal can say why, and the one that wrote it is told those words
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'please look at the diff'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    When I read the message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And I refuse the message, saying {'not before the tests pass'}
    Then the machine was told to refuse {'msg-1.json'} of {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the refusal gave the reason {'not before the tests pass'}
    And it says {'The task that wrote it is told, with your words.'}

  # Tell: the person's own words into the task's inbox, where its agent reads, never out of the machine.
  Scenario: a person writes to a task's own agent, straight into its inbox
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}
    When I choose {'Write to its agent'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    And I put {'stop the migration, the schema changed'} in its inbox
    Then a person told {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} {'stop the migration, the schema changed'}
    And the status line mentions {'Written into the inbox of sokar-checkout-migrate'}

  Scenario: writing to a task's agent needs words, and cancelling writes nothing
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    When I choose {'Write to its agent'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    Then putting it in its inbox is not offered yet
    And I cancel the words
    And nobody told any task anything

  Scenario: leaving a message for now decides nothing
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'please look at the diff'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    When I read the message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And I leave the message for now
    Then nothing was decided about any message
    And what needs a person shows a message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}

  # Decided: a refused message is read in full, and a person may still
  # deliver it. It is then said as delivered despite the filter, never as released.
  # Walk 8: "Held until…" said less than what the message says. Its text is not shown
  # before a person opens it where the filter refused it: that text is what the filter kept back.
  Scenario: a held message shows the start of its text in its row, one the filter refused never does
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'please look at the diff'}
    And {'sokar-billing-shell'} has a message the filter refused, for {'partner'}, saying {'key AKIA0000'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then the row of the message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'} previews {'please look at the diff'}
    And the row of the message from {'sokar-billing-shell'} previews {''}

  Scenario: a message the filter refused is read in full, and can be delivered despite the filter
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message the filter refused, for {'partner'}, saying {'key AKIA0000'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    When I read the message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    Then the message reads exactly {'key AKIA0000'}
    And it says {'rule aws-key'}
    And it says {'checks it again with its own filter'}
    And the message can be delivered despite the filter or kept refused
    When I release the message
    Then the machine was told to release {'msg-1.json'} of {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And it says {'Delivered despite the filter'}

  # Sokar's condition: what the filter could not check is never offered.
  Scenario: a message the filter could not check is not offered for delivery
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message the filter could not check
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then what needs a person shows no message
    And nothing needs me

  Scenario: a message decided somewhere else meanwhile is said to be gone, and nothing is decided
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'please look at the diff'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    And the message was decided somewhere else
    When I read the message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    Then it says {'It is no longer there'}
    And the message cannot be decided here

  # An older daemon cannot list them, and saying nothing would read as nothing waiting.
  Scenario: a machine that cannot list held messages says so, rather than showing none
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the machine cannot list held messages
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then it says {'cannot list the messages held for a person'}

  # Whom a task may talk to follows from its project; here each peer is moderated. A peer is never
  # shown as reachable while everything to it waits.
  # Walk 9: whom work may talk to and what is asked is the project's file; here only the brake.
  Scenario: the peers of a task's project are listed, each with its brake, and the rules are said to be in the project's file
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} may talk to {'reviewer'}, {'vouched'}, in {'prompt'}
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} may talk to {'partner'}, {'external'}, in {'allow'}, held
    And the app is running
    When I choose {"Hold its project's messages to a peer"} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    Then the peer {'reviewer'} is not held
    And the peer {'partner'} is held
    And it says {'Holding applies to every task of checkout, including one started later'}
    And it says {"is set in the project's project.yml"}
    And it says {'in its repository'}
    And it does not say {'under Settings on its page'}
    And it does not say {'External: what arrives from it is checked again here'}

  # Walk 8: "Written to michi" read as writing to oneself; who a peer is had to be guessed from `matrix:`.
  Scenario: who a peer in the project's conversation is, is said
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} may talk to {'michi'} through the project's conversation, {'external'}
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} may talk to {'reader'} through the project's conversation, {'vouched'}
    And the app is running
    When I choose {"Hold its project's messages to a peer"} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    Then it says {'Whoever reads this project’s conversation in a matrix client, by the name michi'}
    And it says {'Another piece of work in this project'}

  # `off` is said as what it is: nothing is asked, and the filter still runs.
  # Outside an online project that is refused, and the daemon's own sentence names the setting.
  Scenario: holding everything for a peer is asked of the machine, and the peer is shown as waiting
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} may talk to {'reviewer'}, {'vouched'}, in {'allow'}
    And the app is running
    When I choose {"Hold its project's messages to a peer"} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    And I hold everything for {'reviewer'}
    Then the machine was told to hold {'reviewer'} of {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} in {'checkout'}
    And the peer {'reviewer'} is held

  # Written, never sent: a person's message goes through the same filter and moderation.
  Scenario: a task whose project names no peers is said to talk to nobody
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    When I choose {"Hold its project's messages to a peer"} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    Then it says {'names no peers, so it may talk to nobody'}

  # Followed live from Talk and filtered here per task. The stream never carries what a message
  # said, and replays nothing, which the view says rather than showing a history it does not have.
  Scenario: what happened to a task's messages is followed live, for that task only, and never what they said
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} may talk to {'reviewer'}, {'vouched'}, in {'prompt'}
    And the app is running
    When the machine says {'msg-7.json'} of {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} was {'overridden'}
    And the machine says {'msg-8.json'} of {'sokar-checkout-shell'} was {'sent'}
    And I choose {"Hold its project's messages to a peer"} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    Then it says {'msg-7.json (reviewer) delivered by a person despite the filter'}
    And it does not say {'msg-8.json'}
    And it says {'the machine does not stream what came before'}

  # One arriving from an external peer is held on its way in, before any task has seen it, so the
  # list says which way each message was going.
  Scenario: a held message says which way it was going
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'please look at the diff'}
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held coming in from {'partner'} saying {'here is the file'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then it says {'going out from sokar-checkout-shell to reviewer'}
    And it says {'coming in from partner to sokar-checkout-shell'}
    # Walk 10: one held on its way in was taken for the one sent. What is decided is only the task's copy.
    And it says {'Whoever wrote it has sent it already; it only waits to reach sokar-checkout-shell.'}
    And it says {'Read it, and decide whether sokar-checkout-shell gets it'}

  # Absent is not zero: a daemon that does not count says nothing about what was used.
  # Whether anything to that peer is held right now, read from what the machine lists as waiting.
  Scenario: a peer says how many messages with it wait for a person now
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} may talk to {'reviewer'}, {'vouched'}, in {'prompt'}
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'first'}
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} has a message held for {'reviewer'} saying {'second'}
    And the app is running
    When I choose {"Hold its project's messages to a peer"} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    Then it says {'2 messages with it wait for a person now'}

  # Filtered here per task and per project: the stream covers every mailbox on the machine.
  Scenario: what happened is followed for the whole project on request, and never another project's
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} may talk to {'reviewer'}, {'vouched'}, in {'prompt'}
    And the app is running
    When the machine says {'msg-7.json'} of {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} was {'held'}
    And the machine says {'msg-8.json'} of {'sokar-checkout-shell'} was {'sent'}
    And the machine says {'msg-9.json'} of {'sokar-billing-shell'} was {'sent'}
    And I choose {"Hold its project's messages to a peer"} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    Then it says {'msg-7.json'}
    And it does not say {'msg-8.json'}
    When I follow what happens for the whole project
    Then it says {'msg-8.json'}
    And it does not say {'msg-9.json'}

  # One held on its way in is released to the task it was for, never back out.
  Scenario: releasing a message held on its way in says it reaches the task
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-shell'} has a message held coming in from {'partner'} saying {'here is the review'}
    And the app is running
    And I go to what needs a person
    When I read the message from {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And I release the message
    Then it says {'Released. The next pass checks it again, as every arrival is checked'}
    And it says {'one held for its signature is held again'}
    And it does not say {'goes out'}

  # A person's release goes whatever a hold says: the switch says so.
  Scenario: holding everything for a peer says a person's release still goes
    Given a backend with work on it
    And {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} may talk to {'reviewer'}, {'vouched'}, in {'prompt'}
    And the app is running
    When I choose {"Hold its project's messages to a peer"} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    Then it says {'Nothing goes to it unless a person releases it, or until this is off again'}
