Feature: Handing a file to running work, taking it back, and its record

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And this machine takes files handed to work up to {8388608} bytes
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}
    And I select the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'}

  Scenario: a file handed in is listed with its size and who handed it in
    Given a file {'notes.txt'} of {300} bytes is picked
    When I choose {'Hand it a file from this computer'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the file is read and sent
    Then the status line mentions {'notes.txt is in sokar-checkout-shell now'}
    When I open the selection
    Then it says {'notes.txt, 300 bytes, by somebody'}
    And it says {'notes.txt given by somebody'}

  Scenario: a file the machine never places is not shown as handed in
    Given a file {'notes.txt'} of {300} bytes is picked
    And the machine will keep the parts but never place the file
    When I choose {'Hand it a file from this computer'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the file is read and sent
    Then the status line mentions {'placed nothing'}
    When I open the selection
    Then it does not say {'notes.txt, 300 bytes'}

  Scenario: a file larger than the work takes is refused before anything is sent
    Given a file {'big.bin'} of {9000000} bytes is picked
    When I choose {'Hand it a file from this computer'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the file is read and sent
    Then the status line mentions {'takes at most 8 MiB. Nothing was sent.'}
    And no part was sent

  Scenario: a transfer cut off goes on where the machine says, not from the start
    Given a file {'cut.bin'} of {2500000} bytes is picked
    And the machine will lose the reply to the next part
    When I choose {'Hand it a file from this computer'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the file is read and sent
    Then the parts sent started at {'0, 0, 1048576, 2097152'}
    And the file {'cut.bin'} arrived whole

  Scenario Outline: a refusal says what to do about it, in its own words
    Given a file {'notes.txt'} of {300} bytes is picked
    And the machine will refuse the next file with {<refusal>}
    When I choose {'Hand it a file from this computer'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the file is read and sent
    Then the status line mentions {<words>}

    Examples:
      | refusal            | words                                                     |
      | 'NotRunning'       | 'a file goes only to running work'                        |
      | 'FileNameRefused'  | 'Hand it in under another name'                           |
      | 'HandInInProgress' | 'Wait for it, or hand this one in under another name'     |
      | 'FileDiffers'      | 'nothing was placed. Hand it in again'                    |

  Scenario: a file taken back is gone, and the record keeps both
    Given a file {'brief.txt'} of {40} bytes is picked
    When I choose {'Hand it a file from this computer'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the file is read and sent
    And I choose {'Take back a file it was handed'} from the menu of the tile {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And I choose {'brief.txt, 40 bytes, by somebody'}
    Then the status line mentions {'brief.txt is out of sokar-checkout-shell again'}
    When I open the selection
    Then it says {'nothing, under /sokar/files'}
    And it says {'brief.txt taken back by somebody'}

  Scenario: what Sokar hands in itself reads as Sokar's, never as a person's
    Given the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'} was handed {'verdict.json'} by Sokar
    When I open the selection
    Then it says {'verdict.json, 120 bytes, by Sokar'}

  Scenario: a machine without hand-in offers it as unavailable, with why
    Given this machine cannot hand files to work
    When I open the actions for {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    Then the action {'Hand it a file from this computer'} is offered as unavailable

  Scenario: a machine without hand-in shows no files, rather than none
    Given this machine cannot hand files to work
    When I open the selection
    Then it does not say {'Handed in'}
