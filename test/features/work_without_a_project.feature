Feature: Work on a repository without writing a project first

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the machine has the project default
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work

  # default is every machine's, kept by Sokar, and nobody configures it.
  Scenario: default is the project shown first, and cannot be stopped following
    Then the first project on the machine is {'default'}
    When I select the project {'default'}
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Stop following this project'} is unavailable because {'default is always there'}

  # One way, the operator's decision: a repository is named, typed or picked at a forge beside the
  # field, and work starts on it; it goes into default on the way.
  Scenario: work in default starts on a repository named by its address, which goes into default on the way
    When I select the project {'default'}
    And I press the start tile
    Then it says {'which cannot be changed'}
    And it says {'Approved work goes to the repository’s origin'}
    When I start work in default on {'git@example.org:acme/tools.git'}
    Then default holds {'tools'} at {'git@example.org:acme/tools.git'}
    And the repository {'tools'} is chosen

  Scenario: a repository worked on before in default is started on again without naming it
    Given default holds {'tools'} at {'git@example.org:acme/tools.git'} already
    When I select the project {'default'}
    And I start work in this project
    And I start work in default on the one called {'tools'}
    Then the repository {'tools'} is chosen
    And nothing was put into default again

  # Picked at a forge, the machine gets a key of its own there, as working on a project gives it.
  Scenario: a repository picked at a forge beside the address fills it, and the machine gets its key there
    Given the forge reaches {'acme/api'} as an admin, and {'acme/web'} without admin rights
    And the keychain here keeps the token {'ghp_accepted'} for the forge
    When I select the project {'default'}
    And I start work in this project
    And I pick {'acme/api'} at the forge for default
    Then the address for default reads {'git@github.com:acme/api.git'}
    When I start work on it from default
    Then default holds {'api'} at {'git@github.com:acme/api.git'}
    And the forge holds {'sokar vm default/api'} at {'acme/api'} once
    When I put the start away
    # Taken out again, from default's own menu, the key the machine forgot still opens the
    # repository there until it is removed.
    When I choose the command {'Repositories worked on without a project'}
    And I take {'api'} out of default
    And I remove its key at the forge too
    Then the forge holds no key titled {'sokar vm default/api'} at {'acme/api'}

  # Opened from its row, as a person new to Sokar opens it: what it is, and the way to its repositories.
  Scenario: default opened from its row says what it is and offers its repositories, and nothing it lacks
    When I select the project {'default'}
    Then the project header does not say {'not followed here'}
    And the project header does not say {'environment not prepared'}
    And the project header says {'worked on with Sokar’s own settings'}
    And the start tile says {'Start work'}

  # A followed project that names the repository takes it over for new tasks.
  Scenario: a repository a followed project names too is offered to be taken out of default
    Given default holds {'api'} at {'git@github.com:acme/api.git'}, named by {'payments'} too
    When I select the project {'default'}
    And I choose the command {'Repositories worked on without a project'}
    Then it says {'payments names it too: its next task starts there'}
    When I take {'api'} out of default
    Then default no longer holds {'api'}
    And it says {'Its mirror, and anything waiting in it, stay'}

  Scenario: only default holds repositories without a project
    When I select the project {'checkout'}
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Repositories worked on without a project'} is unavailable because {'only default holds'}

  # Approved work without a project goes to its repository's origin, never to a project's upstream.
  Scenario: work waiting in default is forwarded to its origin
    When I select the project {'default'}
    And I review what is waiting at the gate
    And I open the waiting push
    Then it says {'Forward it to its origin'}
    When I start forwarding it to its origin
    Then the forwarding asks {'Forward it to its origin'}

  # Walk 10, the operator: Default left Projects; its work is under Work, and a repository is put
  # into it from its card on the forge's page.
  Scenario: work without a project is not listed among the projects
    When I go to the place {'projects'}
    Then it does not say {'Default'}
    And the projects page lists {'checkout'} on {'this machine'}
