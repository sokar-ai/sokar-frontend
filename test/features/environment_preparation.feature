Feature: Building a project's environment, and watching it run

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}

  # Nothing is started: this builds the image a task would otherwise build on its way to running,
  # which is where the first task in a project spends its minutes.
  Scenario: an environment is built without starting anything
    When I build the environment for this project
    And I choose to build {'what changed'}
    Then the build asked for {'CACHED'}
    And nothing was started

  # The depth is what the build costs, and it is asked before the build rather than warned about
  # afterwards. Three, because three are real: the middle one keeps the base image and its
  # packages, and works by invalidating the cache where the agent's layers begin.
  Scenario: the depths say what each replaces and roughly what it costs
    When I build the environment for this project
    Then it says {'Keeps the base image and the packages on it'}
    And it says {'Roughly a minute or two.'}
    And it says {'Throws away the packages on the base image as well'}
    And it says {'Roughly several minutes, and it downloads.'}

  Scenario: the deepest rebuild is asked for as itself
    When I build the environment for this project
    And I choose to build {'everything'}
    Then the build asked for {'EVERYTHING'}

  Scenario: progress is visible while it runs, and the frame stays usable
    When I build the environment for this project
    And I choose to build {'what changed'}
    Then the operation shows {'STEP 4/6: RUN apt-get install -y git'}
    When I close what is open
    Then the project {'checkout'} is listed

  # A build fails at a line of a Containerfile, and the one thing somebody needs is which line.
  Scenario: a build that fails names the step, and it is still readable afterwards
    Given the next build will fail
    When I build the environment for this project
    And I choose to build {'what changed'}
    Then it says {'STEP 4/6: RUN apt-get install -y git returned 100'}
    When I show what this session has run
    Then the record marks it as failed

  # `Prepare` takes the project file, so a project nothing recorded one for cannot be prepared —
  # unlike removing what was built, which takes the name.
  Scenario: a project whose file nothing can find says why it cannot be built
    When I select the project {'unrecorded'}
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Build the environment for this project'} is offered as unavailable
