Feature: Naming a job so it can be started again

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}

  Scenario: a job is named, and becomes an action of its own
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose {'Unattended, against a prompt'}
    And I ask it to {'Run the nightly tests'}
    And I keep it as {'nightly-tests'}
    And I leave without starting
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command finder names {'Run nightly-tests in checkout'}

  Scenario: starting from a named job is one action, and it runs what the job carried
    Given the job {'nightly-tests'} is already named
    When I choose the command {'Run nightly-tests in checkout'}
    And I start it
    Then the launch asked for the mode {'UNATTENDED'}
    And the launch asked it to {'Run the nightly tests'}

  Scenario: what the job asks for is editable before it runs
    Given the job {'nightly-tests'} is already named
    When I choose the command {'Run nightly-tests in checkout'}
    Then what to ask it says {'Run the nightly tests'}
    When I ask it to {'Run the nightly tests, and the slow ones too'}
    And I start it
    Then the launch asked it to {'Run the nightly tests, and the slow ones too'}

  Scenario: a job named in one project is not offered in another
    Given the job {'nightly-tests'} is already named
    When I select the project {'billing'}
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command finder does not name {'Run nightly-tests in checkout'}

  Scenario: a named job outlives the run that named it
    Given the job {'nightly-tests'} is already named
    When the app is restarted
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command finder names {'Run nightly-tests in checkout'}

  # Every start names a repository, so a job keeps the one it was named with.
  Scenario: a job keeps the repository it was named with, and starts there
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose {'Unattended, against a prompt'}
    And I choose the repository {'payments-api'}
    And I ask it to {'Run the nightly tests'}
    And I keep it as {'nightly-tests'}
    And I leave without starting
    And I choose the command {'Run nightly-tests in checkout'}
    Then the repository {'payments-api'} is chosen
    When I start it
    Then the launch was in the repository {'payments-api'}

  Scenario: a job named without a repository has one chosen when it starts, not for it
    Given the job {'nightly-tests'} is already named
    And the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    When I choose the command {'Run nightly-tests in checkout'}
    Then no repository is chosen yet
