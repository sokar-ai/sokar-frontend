Feature: Starting work with an agent, a mode and a credential

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}

  # Pressing start is answered at once; the machine is asked behind the open dialog. Waiting for it
  # first left the press without any sign, and it was pressed twice.
  Scenario: the start dialog opens at once, and says it is still asking the machine
    Given reading the agents is slow
    When I start work in this project
    Then it says {'Asking the machine what it has'}
    When the machine has answered
    Then it does not say {'Asking the machine what it has'}

  # Measured on walk8: CanStart said the agent was not installed while Agents listed it,
  # and asking again answered ready. Start it stayed off until somebody chose the agent again.
  Scenario: an agent the machine lists, refused once as not installed, is asked about again
    Given the machine refuses the agent as not installed {1} times
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'schema-work'}
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then it does not say {'is not installed'}
    When I start it
    Then the launch was called {'schema-work'}

  Scenario: an agent refused as not installed is named in the sentence
    Given the machine refuses the agent as not installed {5} times
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then it says {'an-agent is not installed on this machine'}

  Scenario: work is started with a name, an agent and a mode
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'schema-work'}
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I start it
    Then the launch was called {'schema-work'}
    And the launch asked for the mode {'AGENT'}
    And the launch named the project {'checkout'}

  # The operator's decision: a name is required, filled in from the repository; an unnamed start was
  # called `shell` by the machine, which read as the wrong way of taking part.
  Scenario: the name is filled in from the repository chosen, and is what the work is called
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose the repository {'payments-api'}
    Then the name offered is {'payments-api'}
    When I start it
    Then the launch was called {'payments-api'}

  Scenario: a name somebody typed is kept when the repository changes
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'schema-work'}
    And I choose the repository {'payments-api'}
    Then the name offered is {'schema-work'}

  Scenario: without a name nothing starts
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose the repository {'payments-api'}
    And I call it {''}
    Then starting is not offered yet

  # Walk 9, the operator: a name the project's work has already was refused only when started.
  Scenario: a name the project's work has already is refused as it is typed
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'shell'}
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then the name is refused saying {'The name "shell" is taken'}
    And starting is not offered yet

  # The operator's Foo Bar was sent, the image was built, and only podman's create refused the name.
  Scenario: a name no container could have is refused before anything starts
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'Foo Bar'}
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then the name is refused saying {'cannot hold a space'}
    And starting is not offered yet

  # A case-insensitive filesystem makes Foo and foo one git ref.
  Scenario: a name in upper case is refused, because two of them could be one ref
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'Schema-Work'}
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then the name is refused saying {'lowercase'}
    And starting is not offered yet

  Scenario: a name of other characters, or with a hyphen at its edge, is refused
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'schema_work-'}
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then the name is refused saying {'starts and ends with a letter or a digit'}
    And starting is not offered yet

  # A login container is sokar-login-<digits>.
  Scenario: a name of only digits is refused
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'123'}
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then the name is refused saying {'only digits'}
    And starting is not offered yet

  # The container name holds the prefix, and the task's longest socket path has to fit.
  Scenario: a name too long for its project is refused, saying how long it may be
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'}
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then the name is refused saying {'at most 65 fit'}
    And starting is not offered yet

  # The machine's rule is the authority, and its sentence carries a name that would do.
  # Named last, so only typing it can have asked the machine about it.
  Scenario: a name the machine refuses is refused in its words
    Given the machine refuses the name {'login-7'} saying {'kept for login containers - login7 would do'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I call it {'login-7'}
    Then the name is refused saying {'login7 would do'}
    And starting is not offered yet
    And the machine was asked about the name {'login-7'}

  # The operator's decision: a first start lands in the agent's session, not in a shell to type it into.
  Scenario: a start works through the agent's session unless somebody chooses otherwise
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then the way of taking part chosen is {'A shell, driven by hand'}

  Scenario: an unattended run is not started without being told what to do
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose {'Unattended, against a prompt'}
    Then starting is not offered yet

  Scenario: a prompt belongs to an unattended run and to nothing else
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then what to ask it cannot be filled in

  Scenario: what was chosen is what is sent
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose {'Unattended, against a prompt'}
    And I ask it to {'Fix the rounding and add a test'}
    And I start it
    Then the launch asked for the mode {'UNATTENDED'}
    And the launch asked it to {'Fix the rounding and add a test'}

  Scenario: an unattended run goes to the session, so leaving the dialog does not stop watching
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose {'Unattended, against a prompt'}
    And I ask it to {'Fix the rounding and add a test'}
    And I start it
    And the operation prints {'agent: reading lib/money.dart'}
    Then the operation shows {'agent: reading lib/money.dart'}

  Scenario: a finished unattended run is continued with what it was asked to do last time
    When I select the work {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    And I continue this work
    Then what to ask it says {'Fix the rounding in Money.pennies'}

  Scenario: work that is still running is not offered a new prompt
    When I select the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And I open the command finder
    Then the command {'Continue this work with a new prompt'} is offered as unavailable

  Scenario: an agent that could not be read is named rather than left out
    Given one agent on the machine cannot be read
    When I start work in this project
    Then it says {'could not be read'}

  Scenario: a prompt typed and then set aside is not sent with a mode that has no use for it
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose {'Unattended, against a prompt'}
    And I ask it to {'Fix the rounding and add a test'}
    And I choose {'A shell, driven by hand'}
    And I start it
    Then the launch asked for the mode {'AGENT'}
    And the launch was asked for nothing in particular

  Scenario: a missing credential is named before anything is started
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then it says {'The vault holds no credential called a-provider'}
    And nothing was started

  # A missing credential is stored from where it was found missing, by the line the machine names
  # for its provider, in a terminal there — and then the machine is asked again.
  Scenario: a missing credential is stored from the start dialog, and starting is asked about again
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I store the credential from the start
    Then a terminal runs {'sh -c sokar vault put a-provider'} on the machine
    When the unlock terminal ends and is put away
    Then whether work can start is asked again

  Scenario: a machine that cannot say how to store a credential says so, rather than nothing
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    And the machine cannot say its providers
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I store the credential from the start
    Then the status line mentions {'could not say how to store'}

  # A login prints its page as an OSC 8 link. It is offered to be opened here — never opened by
  # itself, and never anything but a web address.
  Scenario: a link the terminal marks is opened in the browser here with a press, and only then
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I store the credential from the start
    And the terminal prints a link to {'https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize?code=true'}
    Then nothing was opened in the browser
    When I open the link to {'https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize?code=true'}
    Then the browser was given {'https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize?code=true'}

  Scenario: a link that is not a web address is never offered
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I store the credential from the start
    And the terminal prints a link that would run {'file:///usr/bin/xcalc'}
    Then the terminal offers no link

  # The agent's own login, where it declares one: its page is a link to open here, and its reply
  # to localhost is forwarded to the machine for as long as the login's terminal is open.
  Scenario: an agent that declares a login is logged in from the start, its reply forwarded
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    And the agent {'an-agent'} logs in by its own login
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I log in with the agent from the start
    Then a terminal runs {'sokar vault login --agent an-agent'} on the machine
    When the login prints its page {'https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize'} and its reply port {'42017'}
    Then the reply port {'42017'} is forwarded
    And nothing was opened in the browser
    When I open the link to {'https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize'}
    Then the browser was given {'https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize'}
    # A login that builds an image first prints nothing for minutes: said, and not put away by a press.
    And the terminal says {'The first sign-in builds'}
    And the terminal offers no Done while it runs
    When I cancel the sign-in and let it run after all
    Then the terminal says {'The first sign-in builds'}
    When the unlock terminal ends and is put away
    Then the reply forward is taken down
    And whether work can start is asked again

  # The address is the daemon's, and one that does not parse is not offered as a link.
  Scenario: how an agent's login works is offered when its address is one
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    And the agent {'an-agent'} documents its login at {'https://docs.example.test/login'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then it says {'How this login works'}

  Scenario: an address that is not one is not offered as a link
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    And the agent {'an-agent'} documents its login at {'http://[not an address'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then it does not say {'How this login works'}

  # An agent may print a link of its own beside the machine's. The machine marks its own, and that is
  # the one offered first: its reply comes back without a code. The other stays, for an agent without one.
  Scenario: the machine's login page is offered first, and a link of the agent's own below it
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    And the agent {'an-agent'} logs in by its own login
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I log in with the agent from the start
    And the agent prints a link of its own to {'https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize?code=true'}
    And the login prints its page {'https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize'} and its reply port {'42017'}
    Then the first link offered says {'Sign in: the reply comes back here'}, and opens {'https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize'}
    And it says {'Another link the program printed'}

  # The standard pair: Claude Code is the agent a start offers first, where it is installed.
  Scenario: Claude Code is chosen where it is installed and nobody chose another
    Given the machine has Claude Code installed too
    When I start work in this project
    Then the agent chosen is {'claude'}

  # The operator's report: a new person pressed "Start it", landed in a shell, and the agent said
  # "Not logged in". With nothing to sign in with, the sign-in comes first, at the top, and no start.
  Scenario: an agent with nothing to sign in with is signed in first, and no start of any kind is offered
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    And the agent {'an-agent'} logs in by its own login
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then the form asks to sign in to {'An Agent'} first, above everything else
    And it offers {'Sign in first'} instead of starting
    When I press {'Sign in first'}
    Then a terminal runs {'sokar vault login --agent an-agent'} on the machine

  Scenario: a sign-in that stored the credential says so, and the form moves on to the start
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    And the agent {'an-agent'} logs in by its own login
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I log in with the agent from the start
    And the login stores what it signed in with
    And the unlock terminal ends
    Then the terminal ends saying {'Signed in to An Agent: the credential is stored'}
    And no link is offered any more
    When I press {'Done'}
    Then the form no longer asks to sign in

  Scenario: an agent that declares no login is not offered one
    Given the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then logging in is not offered

  Scenario: the credential is stored by the command the readiness answer names
    Given starting says the credential is stored by {'sokar vault put a-provider'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I store the credential from the start
    Then a terminal runs {'sokar vault put a-provider'} on the machine

  # Asked behind an open dialog nobody awaits: a failure let through there reaches nobody but the
  # console, and the dialog sits as if it had asked nothing.
  Scenario: a machine that fails to say whether work can start is said in the dialog
    Given the machine fails to say whether work can start, with {'the vault could not be read'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then it says {'The machine could not say whether work can start: the vault could not be read'}

  # Choosing to work by hand is choosing to be in the work: once it is up, its session opens,
  # rather than a log of the start somebody then has to leave to find the work.
  Scenario: work started to be driven by hand opens its session once it is up
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'schema-work'}
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I start it
    And the start brings up {'sokar-checkout-schema-work'} in {'checkout'}, running {'SHELL'}
    Then the session on screen is {'sokar-checkout-schema-work'}

  # An unattended run has nobody at it: its log is what there is to watch.
  Scenario: an unattended run opens no session when it is up
    When I start work in this project
    And I call it {'nightly'}
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose {'Unattended, against a prompt'}
    And I ask it to {'run the tests'}
    And I start it
    And the start brings up {'sokar-checkout-nightly'} in {'checkout'}, running {'UNATTENDED'}
    Then no session was opened

  Scenario: a locked vault is a different sentence, and points at the machine
    Given the vault is locked
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then it says {'Unlock it at the machine'}
    And it says {'a daemon has no terminal'}
    And opening it with this device is not offered

  Scenario: a missing credential is not answered by opening the vault, even on an enrolled device
    Given this device is enrolled on the machine
    And the vault holds no credential for what a run would use
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then opening it with this device is not offered

  Scenario: a locked vault is opened from the start with this device, where it is enrolled, and asked again
    Given this device is enrolled on the machine
    And the vault is locked
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I open the vault from the start with this device {'for an hour'}
    Then the machine was asked to open it for {60} minutes
    And whether work can start is asked again once the vault is open

  Scenario: choosing a provider is not storing a secret
    Given the agent names no default provider
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then it says {'this is a provider, not a secret'}

  Scenario: an unattended run that cannot authenticate is not offered at all
    Given the vault is locked
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose {'Unattended, against a prompt'}
    And I ask it to {'Fix the rounding'}
    Then starting is not offered yet
    And it says {'no container, no workspace, nothing to clear up'}

  Scenario: an interactive run is offered anyway, and says what it will cost
    Given the vault is locked
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then it says {'a container you will have to clear up'}


  # The operator's decision: work always starts in a named repository, and none is chosen
  # for anybody — not even when there is only one.
  Scenario: work starts in a repository somebody chose, never in one chosen for them
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api, billing'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then no repository is chosen yet
    And starting is not offered yet
    And nothing warns about starting
    When I choose the repository {'payments-api'}
    Then the machine was asked whether work can start in {'payments-api'}
    When I start it
    Then the launch was in the repository {'payments-api'}

  # A project naming others under `repositories:` is never worked in itself: it holds the file, the
  # planning and the issues, and the machine refuses a start there.
  Scenario: a project that names other repositories never offers its own to work in
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api, billing'}
    When I start work in this project
    Then the repository {'checkout'} is not offered to start in
    And no repository is chosen yet

  Scenario: a project with one repository to work in has it chosen
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    When I start work in this project
    Then the repository {'checkout'} is not offered to start in
    And the repository chosen is {'payments-api'}

  # A repository still to choose is not a refusal, even for a run nobody watches.
  Scenario: an unattended run waiting for its repository is not told it would be refused
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api, billing'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose {'Unattended, against a prompt'}
    And I ask it to {'Fix the rounding'}
    Then starting is not offered yet
    And nothing warns about starting

  # A Sokar older than repositories per project names no repositories and is sent none.
  Scenario: a machine that names no repositories is asked for none
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I start it
    Then the launch named no repository

  # Continuing is more of the same work, so it goes on where that work is — not a new choice.
  Scenario: work continued goes on in the repository it worked in
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    And the work {'sokar-checkout-migrate'} works in the repository {'payments-api'}
    When I select the work {'sokar-checkout-migrate'}
    And I continue this work
    Then the repository {'payments-api'} is chosen

  # Beyond what the project names: a vault entry for a destination, given by a person, never by default.
  Scenario: work is given a vault entry for a destination, and says how it appears inside
    Given the machine declares the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I give it the entry {'a-provider'} for {'weather'}
    Then it says {'a-provider for weather, reaching api.weather.example: inside the task as SOKAR_TOKEN_A_PROVIDER'}
    When I start it
    Then the launch was given {'a-provider'} for {'weather'}

  Scenario: work is given nothing beyond its project unless somebody gives it
    Given the machine declares the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I start it
    Then the launch was given nothing beyond its project

  Scenario: a machine without destinations says nothing more can be given
    When I start work in this project
    And I open more options
    Then it says {'No destination is declared on this machine.'}

  # What was given belongs to the work it was given to, not to the dialog the next time.
  Scenario: a vault entry given to work left unstarted is not given to the next
    Given the machine declares the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I give it the entry {'a-provider'} for {'weather'}
    And I leave without starting
    And I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I start it
    Then the launch was given nothing beyond its project

  # Two files of one name, one in force: the one in force is what the work reaches, and offered once.
  Scenario: a destination put in a package's place is offered once, where it is now
    Given a package declares the destination {'search'} at {'https://api.search.example'}
    And the machine's own {'search'} takes the package's place at {'https://search.internal.example'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I give it the entry {'a-provider'} for {'search'}
    Then it says {'a-provider for search, reaching search.internal.example'}

  # A provider is a place an entry can be for as well, as Start takes it.
  Scenario: work is given a vault entry for a provider
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I give it the entry {'a-provider'} for {'A Provider, a provider'}
    Then it says {'a-provider for a-provider, reaching api.example.test'}
    When I start it
    Then the launch was given {'a-provider'} for {'a-provider'}

  # What the project names is given anyway: named, and not offered again to point elsewhere.
  Scenario: the credentials a project names are named when starting, and not offered to give again
    Given the machine declares the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    And the project {'checkout'} names the credential {'a-provider'} for {'weather'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I open more options
    Then it says {'a-provider for weather: inside the task as SOKAR_TOKEN_A_PROVIDER'}
    And the entry {'a-provider'} is not offered to give

  Scenario: a project that names no credential of its own says so
    Given the machine declares the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    And the project {'checkout'} names no credential of its own
    When I start work in this project
    And I open more options
    Then it says {'Its project gives it no credential of its own.'}

  # Asked with what it is given, since the answer turns on it.
  Scenario: whether work can start is asked again with the credentials it is given
    Given the machine declares the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I give it the entry {'a-provider'} for {'weather'}
    Then the machine was last asked whether it can start with {'a-provider'} for {'weather'}

  # Start refuses it in every mode before anything exists, so even a shell is not offered.
  Scenario: a credential for a destination the machine does not declare stops even a shell
    Given the machine declares the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I give it the entry {'a-provider'} for {'weather'}
    And the destination {'weather'} is no longer declared
    Then it says {'no destination or provider of that name is declared here'}
    And starting is not offered yet

  # From a machine older than that, empty means not said: never shown as "none".
  Scenario: a machine that does not say what a project names says it is not said
    When I start work in this project
    And I open more options
    Then it says {'this machine does not say what that is'}
    And it does not say {'Its project gives it no credential of its own.'}

  # Granting, once, in a browser: offered where it is asked for, and asked about again afterwards.
  Scenario: an entry nobody has granted is granted from the start, and starting is asked about again
    Given nobody has granted {'jira'} yet
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    Then it says {'Nobody has granted jira yet.'}
    And it says {'It starts, and jira is not granted'}
    And starting is offered
    When I grant it from the start
    And the machine asks for a decision on {'https://auth.example.com/device'} with the code {'WDJB-MJHT'}
    And the machine says the grant is {'granted'}
    And I am done granting
    Then it does not say {'Nobody has granted jira yet.'}

  Scenario: an unattended run is not started without a grant nobody gave
    Given nobody has granted {'jira'} yet
    When I start work in this project
    And I choose the agent {'An Agent'}
    And I choose {'Unattended, against a prompt'}
    And I ask it to {'Sync the tickets'}
    Then it says {'Nobody has granted jira yet.'}
    And starting is not offered yet
