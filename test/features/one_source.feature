Feature: Where a repository's work comes from and goes, and catching up

  # One source per repository, used both ways. Started in a checkout, the checkout is the source
  # and approved work comes back into it; added by address, the remote is. A person reads which, and
  # brings a running task up to its source without stopping it.
  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the machine has the project default
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work

  Scenario: a repository started in a checkout says its work comes from it and goes back there
    Given default holds {'app'} from the checkout {'/home/walk9/walk/app'} whose remote is {'git@example.org:app.git'}
    When I select the project {'default'}
    And I choose the command {'Repositories worked on without a project'}
    Then it says {'From the checkout /home/walk9/walk/app, and back into it as sokar/<task>'}
    And it says {'its remote git@example.org:app.git is yours to pull and push'}

  Scenario: a repository added by its address says its work comes from that remote and goes there
    Given default holds {'tools'} from the remote {'git@example.org:acme/tools.git'}
    When I select the project {'default'}
    And I choose the command {'Repositories worked on without a project'}
    Then it says {'From git@example.org:acme/tools.git, and back there'}

  Scenario: a machine older than one source shows the address as before
    Given default holds {'tools'} at {'git@example.org:acme/tools.git'} already
    When I select the project {'default'}
    And I choose the command {'Repositories worked on without a project'}
    Then it says {'git@example.org:acme/tools.git'}
    And it does not say {'and back there'}

  Scenario: a running task is brought up to its source, and its agent is told
    Given a refresh moves {'main'} to {'111df4193e7e0011'}
    When I select the project {'checkout'}
    And I select the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And I choose the command {'Bring it up to its source'}
    Then the machine was asked to refresh the task {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And the status line mentions {'main moved to 111df4193e7e; its agent was told, and git fetch sokar brings it'}

  Scenario: an online task fetches its upstream itself, and says so rather than nothing
    Given a refresh answers {'NOT_GATED'}
    When I select the project {'checkout'}
    And I select the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And I choose the command {'Bring it up to its source'}
    Then the status line mentions {'an online task fetches its upstream itself'}

  Scenario: a refresh that failed says why, in the machine's words
    Given a refresh answers {'FAILED'} because {'the checkout /home/walk9/walk/app is gone'}
    When I select the project {'checkout'}
    And I select the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'}
    And I choose the command {'Bring it up to its source'}
    Then the status line mentions {'could not be brought up to its source: the checkout /home/walk9/walk/app is gone'}
