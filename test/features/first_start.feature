# The Feature line is the report row: one short sentence, 70 characters at most,
# saying what this file tests. It is the group name in every surface CI renders.
Feature: A first start led from a machine to a project to the first work

  # The operator's decision: set up a machine (this computer or one over ssh), then a project
  # unless working without one, then start work. Once there is work, the window opens on it.
  Scenario: with no work anywhere, the work page leads through three steps
    Given a backend with nothing on it
    And the app is running
    Then the section shown is {'Work'}
    And the first step {'machine'} is done {true}
    And the first step {'project'} is done {false}
    And it says {'From a repository you have'}
    When I choose to work without a project first
    Then the first step {'project'} is done {true}
    And it says {'Start the first work'}

  Scenario: a machine that does not answer is the first step still to take
    Given a backend with nothing on it
    And the app is running
    When the tunnel drops
    Then the first step {'machine'} is done {false}
    And it says {'Set up a machine'}
    And it does not say {'Start the first work'}
    When enough time passes for another try
    Then the first step {'machine'} is done {true}

  Scenario: once there is work, the window shows it rather than the first steps
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    Then it does not say {'Three steps, and the first work runs'}
