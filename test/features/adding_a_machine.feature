Feature: Adding a machine through a wizard that starts from what you have

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    When I open the machine dialog

  Scenario: the first page asks for a name and one of three kinds
    Then it says {'Its socket is already forwarded'}
    And it says {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And it says {'A new machine'}

  # Nothing is preselected: the kinds are different commitments, and a default would choose one.
  Scenario: the wizard goes on only with a name and a kind
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    Then the wizard cannot go on yet
    When I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I go on
    Then its socket there is not filled in

  Scenario: a kind without a name does not go on either
    When I choose {'Its socket is already forwarded'}
    Then the wizard cannot go on yet

  Scenario: going back keeps what was said, and another kind can be chosen
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I go on
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And I go back
    And I choose {'Its socket is already forwarded'}
    And I go on
    And the forwarded socket is {'/tmp/sokar-build.sock'}
    And I watch it
    Then nothing was raised for {'the build machine'}

  # BatchMode fails on an unknown key rather than asking, and a key accepted unseen is the one step
  # somebody in the middle needs. So it is shown, and trusting it is a separate act.
  Scenario: a host reached for the first time shows its key before anything logs in
    Given the host key of {'user@build.example.test'} is not known yet
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I try the connection
    Then I am shown the host key {'SHA256:uNiQuEfInGeRpRiNtOfThEbUiLdMaChInE0123456789'}
    And nothing was raised for the trial
    When I trust the host key
    Then the host key of {'build.example.test'} was written
    And the trial says {'Reached Sokar'}

  Scenario: a host key that is not trusted is never written, and nothing is tried
    Given the host key of {'user@build.example.test'} is not known yet
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I try the connection
    And I do not trust the host key
    Then no host key was written
    And the trial says {'was not trusted, so nothing was tried'}
    And nothing was raised for the trial

  Scenario: watching without trying asks about the key too
    Given the host key of {'user@build.example.test'} is not known yet
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I watch it
    Then I am shown the host key {'SHA256:uNiQuEfInGeRpRiNtOfThEbUiLdMaChInE0123456789'}
    When I do not trust the host key
    Then no host key was written
    And nothing was raised for {'the build machine'}

  Scenario: a host already known is not asked about
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'Raise the forward for me'}
    And I say it is at {'user@build.example.test'}
    And its socket there is {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}
    And I try the connection
    Then the trial says {'Reached Sokar'}
    And no host key was written

  # A socket somebody else forwarded names no host, so there is no key of one to ask about.
  Scenario: a socket already forwarded is never asked about a host key
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'Its socket is already forwarded'}
    And the forwarded socket is {'/tmp/sokar-build.sock'}
    And I try the connection
    And I watch it
    Then no host key was asked about

  # The key before the machine: one made afterwards cannot reach a machine that only knows root's.
  Scenario: a new machine starts with a key, kept owner-only, and its public half to copy
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'A new machine'}
    And I go on
    Then the wizard cannot go to the next step yet
    When I generate a key pair
    And I keep the key
    Then the key was kept owner-only as {'sokar-the-build-machine'}
    And it says {'Give this public key to the provider when the server is created'}
    And the public key is shown to copy

  Scenario: pasted halves of two different pairs are refused and nothing is kept
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'A new machine'}
    And I go on
    And I paste the halves of two different key pairs
    And I keep the key
    Then it says {'The public key does not belong to that private key.'}
    And no key was kept
    And the wizard cannot go to the next step yet

  Scenario: root logs in with that key once its host key is trusted
    Given the host key of {'root@203.0.113.10'} is not known yet
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'A new machine'}
    And I go on
    And I generate a key pair
    And I keep the key
    And I go to the next step
    And I say the new machine is at {'203.0.113.10'}
    And I try logging in as root
    Then I am shown the host key {'SHA256:uNiQuEfInGeRpRiNtOfThEbUiLdMaChInE0123456789'}
    When I trust the host key
    Then root logged in to {'203.0.113.10'} with {'sokar-the-build-machine'}
    And it says {'Logged in as root on 203.0.113.10'}
    When I go to the next step
    Then it says {"Sokar's setup script runs as root"}

  Scenario: a root login that fails says what ssh said, and the wizard does not go on
    Given logging in as root will fail with {'root@203.0.113.10: Permission denied (publickey).'}
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'A new machine'}
    And I go on
    And I generate a key pair
    And I keep the key
    And I go to the next step
    And I say the new machine is at {'203.0.113.10'}
    And I try logging in as root
    Then it says {'Permission denied (publickey).'}
    And the wizard cannot go to the next step yet

  Scenario: a host key that is not trusted logs nothing in
    Given the host key of {'root@203.0.113.10'} is not known yet
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'A new machine'}
    And I go on
    And I generate a key pair
    And I keep the key
    And I go to the next step
    And I say the new machine is at {'203.0.113.10'}
    And I try logging in as root
    And I do not trust the host key
    Then it says {'was not trusted, so nothing logged in'}
    And root never logged in

  # What the person reads is the script's own --show, and nothing changes until they run it.
  Scenario: the setup script shows what it would do before anything runs
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    When I see what it can install
    And I fetch the setup script
    Then it shows what the setup script would run {'useradd --create-home agent'}
    And the setup script has not run yet
    When I run the setup script
    Then it says {'The machine is prepared.'}
    And the setup script ran for {'agent'}

  Scenario: an operating system the script does not know is said, and nothing can run
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    And the setup script does not know this operating system
    When I see what it can install
    Then it says {'does not know this operating system'}
    And it says {'Arch Linux'}
    And the setup script cannot be run
    And the setup script has not run yet

  Scenario: a failed check leaves the wizard where it is
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    And the setup script will end with {5}
    When I see what it can install
    And I fetch the setup script
    And I run the setup script
    Then it says {'A check failed and the machine is not usable yet'}
    And the wizard cannot go to the next step yet

  # The Host entry is the work user's, never root's, and the forward is raised the way watching it will.
  Scenario: the prepared machine is reached as the work user and watched
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    When I see what it can install
    And I fetch the setup script
    And I run the setup script
    And I go to the next step
    And I set it up and connect
    Then the key was allowed for {'agent'}
    And ssh config reaches {'sokar-the-build-machine'} as {'agent'} with {'sokar-the-build-machine'}
    And Sokar was started as the work user
    And it says {'Reached Sokar'}
    When I watch the new machine
    Then the forward was raised through {'sokar-the-build-machine'} to {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}

  Scenario: turning off root login is offered, and done only when asked
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    When I see what it can install
    And I fetch the setup script
    And I run the setup script
    And I go to the next step
    And I set it up and connect
    Then root login was not turned off
    When I turn off root and password login
    Then it says {'Logging in as root and with a password is off.'}
    And root login was turned off

  Scenario: the work user is the one the options name
    Given new machines run work as {'builder'}
    And a new machine whose root logs in
    When I see what it can install
    And I fetch the setup script
    Then the setup script was shown for {'builder'}


  Scenario: a key that cannot be allowed for the work user stops before anything else is written
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    And allowing the key for the work user will fail with {'getent: no such user'}
    When I see what it can install
    And I fetch the setup script
    And I run the setup script
    And I go to the next step
    And I set it up and connect
    Then it says {'The key could not be allowed for agent: getent: no such user'}
    And ssh config was not touched
    And Sokar was not started

  # The machine's own package source is the catalogue (QF19); the interface never asks a repository.
  Scenario: what it can install is offered as choices, and what is there is shown fixed
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    When I see what it can install
    Then it offers the package {'sokar-agent-claude'}
    And it offers the package {'sokar-agent-omp'}
    And the package {'sokar-message-transport-local'} is shown installed and cannot be unticked
    And nothing was installed by asking

  Scenario: a chosen agent is shown and run with the rest
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    When I see what it can install
    And I choose the package {'sokar-agent-claude'}
    And I fetch the setup script
    Then the setup script was shown with {'sokar-agent-claude'}
    When I run the setup script
    Then the setup script ran with {'sokar-agent-claude'}

  # What runs is only ever what was shown.
  Scenario: changing the choice after it was shown asks for it to be shown again
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    When I see what it can install
    And I fetch the setup script
    And I choose the package {'sokar-agent-omp'}
    Then it says {'Show it again before it runs'}
    And the setup script cannot be run

  Scenario: an empty catalogue says why
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    And the machine's package source offers nothing yet
    When I see what it can install
    Then it says {'nothing yet'}


  Scenario: the wizard offers the user that runs work, and a name no machine would accept stops it
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'A new machine'}
    Then the user that runs work is offered as {'agent'}
    When I say the user that runs work is {'Not Valid'}
    Then the wizard cannot go on yet
    When I say the user that runs work is {'builder'}
    And I go on
    And I generate a key pair
    And I keep the key
    And I go to the next step
    And I say the new machine is at {'203.0.113.10'}
    And I try logging in as root
    And I go to the next step
    And I see what it can install
    And I fetch the setup script
    Then the setup script was shown for {'builder'}

  # The second wizard: only the parts that make a user, with the key the machine already knows.
  Scenario: another user is added to a machine prepared before, and watched as a machine of its own
    Given a key the machine already knows is kept as {'sokar-the-build-machine'}
    When I cancel the dialog
    And I choose the command {'Add another user that runs work…'}
    Then the wizard offers no kind to choose
    When I say it is called {'the build machine as other'}
    And I say the user that runs work is {'other'}
    And I go on
    And I use the key the machine already knows
    And I go to the next step
    And I say the new machine is at {'203.0.113.10'}
    And I try logging in as root
    And I go to the next step
    Then nothing asks what it can install
    When I fetch the setup script
    And I run the setup script
    Then the setup script ran for {'other'}
    When I go to the next step
    And I set it up and connect
    Then ssh config reaches {'sokar-the-build-machine-as-other'} as {'other'} with {'sokar-the-build-machine'}
    When I watch the new machine
    Then the forward was raised through {'sokar-the-build-machine-as-other'} to {'/run/user/1001/sokar/sokard.sock'}

  Scenario: going back and on again keeps the key and where the machine is
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'A new machine'}
    And I go on
    And I generate a key pair
    And I keep the key
    And I go to the next step
    And I say the new machine is at {'203.0.113.10'}
    And I go back
    And I go back
    And I go on
    Then the public key is shown to copy
    When I go to the next step
    Then the new machine is at {'203.0.113.10'}

  Scenario: the public key can be copied from its field
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'A new machine'}
    And I go on
    And I generate a key pair
    And I copy the public key
    Then what was copied starts with {'ssh-ed25519 '}

  # Cancelled, or the window closed: nothing is asked twice, and nothing is done twice.
  Scenario: a setup that was not finished is offered to be continued where it stopped
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    When I cancel the dialog
    And I open the machine dialog
    Then it says {'Setting up the build machine (203.0.113.10) was not finished.'}
    When I continue the unfinished setup
    Then the new machine is at {'203.0.113.10'}
    When I try logging in as root
    And I go to the next step
    Then it says {"Sokar's setup script runs as root"}

  Scenario: an unfinished setup that is discarded is not offered again
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    When I cancel the dialog
    And I open the machine dialog
    And I discard the unfinished setup
    And I cancel the dialog
    And I open the machine dialog
    Then no unfinished setup is offered

  # Going back or on in the middle of it would draw a step that is not true yet.
  Scenario: while a script runs it says what it is doing, and only Cancel is offered
    Given a new machine whose root logs in
    And the machine takes its time answering
    When I start asking what it can install
    Then it says {'Asking the machine what it can install'}
    And it shows the first line the machine printed
    And only Cancel is offered
    When the machine answers
    Then it offers the package {'sokar-agent-claude'}

  # The third way to a key: one already in ~/.ssh, used where it is rather than copied.
  Scenario: a key already in ~/.ssh can be chosen by name and used as it is
    Given a key the machine already knows is kept as {'id_ed25519'}
    When I cancel the dialog
    And I open the machine dialog
    And I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'A new machine'}
    And I go on
    And I choose the existing key {'id_ed25519'}
    Then the public key is shown to copy
    When I go to the next step
    And I say the new machine is at {'203.0.113.10'}
    And I try logging in as root
    Then root logged in to {'203.0.113.10'} with {'id_ed25519'}

  # A rented server's address given to a new machine: the old key is known, and it is not this one.
  Scenario: a host whose key changed is warned about, and the old key is replaced only when asked
    Given the host key of {'root@203.0.113.10'} changed since it was last seen
    When I say it is called {'the build machine'}
    And I choose {'A new machine'}
    And I go on
    And I generate a key pair
    And I keep the key
    And I go to the next step
    And I say the new machine is at {'203.0.113.10'}
    And I try logging in as root
    Then I am warned that the key is not the one known for that address
    When I trust the host key
    Then the host key of {'203.0.113.10'} was written
    And root logged in to {'203.0.113.10'} with {'sokar-the-build-machine'}
