Feature: Backups of a mirror: listing, removing, restoring, and upstream

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}

  # A bundle is written wherever an operator names it and the command forgets it, so "what has
  # been taken" was never a missing listing — it was a question with no data behind it. What is
  # listed is a record written when each one was taken.
  Scenario: what has been taken is listed with enough to tell two apart
    When I show what has been backed up here
    Then it says {'/srv/checkout/backups/before-sync.bundle'}
    And it says {'2 pushes when it was taken'}
    And it says {'4.0 MB now'}

  # A record is not the bundle. The file can be moved afterwards and nothing here would know, so
  # what was true then and what is true now are told apart rather than merged.
  Scenario: a bundle somebody moved is shown as missing, never dropped
    When I show what has been backed up here
    Then it says {'/srv/checkout/backups/moved-away.bundle'}
    And it says {'the file is not there any more'}

  # An empty list means nothing recorded, never nothing exists.
  Scenario: a project with no record says so, without claiming no bundle exists
    Given nothing has been backed up here
    When I show what has been backed up here
    Then it says {'Nothing is recorded for this project'}
    And it says {'not the same as no bundle existing'}

  Scenario: removing one says what it held before anything goes
    When I show what has been backed up here
    And I consider removing the first backup
    Then it says {'It held 2 pushes nobody had reviewed'}
    And no backup was removed

  Scenario: keeping it removes nothing
    When I show what has been backed up here
    And I consider removing the first backup
    And I keep the backup
    Then no backup was removed

  Scenario: agreeing removes it, and says what it held
    When I show what has been backed up here
    And I consider removing the first backup
    And I remove the backup
    Then it says {'Gone: the bundle and the record of it'}

  # A tidy-up rather than a loss, and saying both the same way would tell somebody they had
  # destroyed something they had not.
  Scenario: clearing the record of a bundle already gone is not called a loss
    Given the bundle is already gone
    When I show what has been backed up here
    And I consider removing the first backup
    And I remove the backup
    Then it says {'The record is cleared. The file was already gone'}

  # `SyncUpstream` is its own method and not a flag on a read: a listing that reached the network
  # would make the queue cost what a listing must not. It writes the same record the timer writes,
  # so a triggered fetch and a timed one cannot disagree.
  Scenario: asking the upstream is one action and says what it found
    When I ask the upstream how far behind this project is
    Then the upstream was asked about {'checkout'}
    And the status line mentions {'3 commits behind the upstream, as of now'}

  # `behind` means nothing unless it was measured, and zero is the answer both for up to date and
  # for nothing having been measurable.
  Scenario: a project with no upstream is not reported as up to date
    Given the upstream cannot be measured because {'NO_UPSTREAM'}
    When I ask the upstream how far behind this project is
    Then the status line mentions {'no upstream, so there is nothing to be behind'}

  Scenario: restoring says what it would overwrite before it does anything
    When I show what has been backed up here
    And I consider restoring the first backup
    Then it says {'This writes over the mirror'}
    And nothing was restored

  # Unreviewed pushes exist only in the mirror — not upstream, not in a workspace, not in the
  # bundle — so overwriting one destroys the only copy there has ever been.
  Scenario: work nobody has reviewed refuses the restore, and says what would go
    Given restoring would destroy {'migrate'}
    When I show what has been backed up here
    And I consider restoring the first backup
    And I restore from it
    Then it says {'Refused: 1 push nobody has reviewed would be destroyed'}
    And it says {'Nothing was written'}

  # Somebody who forced needs it in the record afterwards, not only in the warning they clicked
  # past.
  Scenario: forcing past the refusal says afterwards what it destroyed
    Given restoring would destroy {'migrate'}
    When I show what has been backed up here
    And I consider restoring the first backup
    And I restore from it
    And I restore from it
    Then it says {'1 unreviewed push is gone: migrate'}

  # A bundle somebody moved is listed, because it was taken — but there is nothing to restore
  # from, and offering it would say the record is the thing when it is not.
  Scenario: a bundle that is not there any more cannot be restored from
    When I show what has been backed up here
    Then restoring from the missing backup is not offered

  # Sokar B67: every repository has its own upstream, gate and backups. One number for all of them
  # was the project's own, shown against every other.
  Scenario: every repository says how far it has got, on a line of its own
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    And the repository {'payments-api'} is {'4'} behind with {'2'} waiting
    Then the repository {'payments-api'} says {'2 waiting at the gate · 4 behind'}
    And the repository {'checkout'} says {'checkout, its own'}

  Scenario: a repository's upstream is asked about on its own
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    When I sync the repository {'payments-api'}
    Then the upstream was asked about the repository {'payments-api'}

  # A bundle is kept under the repository it was taken of. Restored into another, it would put one
  # history over the other's and destroy pushes that exist nowhere else.
  Scenario: a repository's backups are its own, and are restored into it
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    When I show the backups of the repository {'payments-api'}
    Then it says {'Backups of checkout · payments-api'}
    When I consider restoring the first backup
    And I restore from it
    Then the backups and the restore were about the repository {'payments-api'}

  Scenario: a machine that names no repositories is asked about none
    When I show what has been backed up here
    And I consider restoring the first backup
    And I ask the upstream how far behind this project is
    Then no repository was named for the backups or the upstream

  # A repository's limits replace the project's key by key. Which keys it replaced is the part worth
  # saying; the rest may be the project's or Sokar's own default, and nothing can tell which.
  Scenario: a repository's limits are shown, the keys it replaced marked as its own
    Given the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    And the repository {'payments-api'} limits its memory to {'4g'}
    Then the repository {'payments-api'} says {'memory 4g (its own)'}
    And the repository {'payments-api'} says {'processes 512'}
    And the repository {'payments-api'} does not say {'processes 512 (its own)'}
