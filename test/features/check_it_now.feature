Feature: Checking a followed project now, not at the next round

  # Without it, a project goes on saying what it said until the machine's next round, with nothing
  # to press. Checking now fetches the project's repository and asks each repository's upstream, and
  # says what came back.
  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And the project {'checkout'} has the repositories {'checkout, payments-api'}
    And the project {'checkout'} is followed from {'git@example.org:checkout.git'}
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}

  Scenario: checking fetches the project and asks each repository, and says what it found
    When I check the project now
    Then the machine was asked to refresh {'checkout'}
    And the upstream was asked about {'checkout'}
    And it says {'Following, at c0ffee1'}
    And it says {'payments-api: 3 commits behind the upstream, as of now'}

  Scenario: while the machine fetches, the page says it is checking
    Given the machine takes its time to refresh
    When I check the project now
    Then it says {'checking…'}
    When the machine answers the refresh
    Then it does not say {'checking…'}
    And it says {'Following, at c0ffee1'}

  Scenario: a fetch that failed says why, in the machine's terms
    Given the next refresh finds {'VAULT_LOCKED'}
    When I check the project now
    Then it says {"This account's store is shut, and the repository needs a credential from it"}

  Scenario: a project this account no longer follows says so, rather than nothing
    Given the machine no longer follows {'checkout'}
    When I check the project now
    Then it says {'checkout is no longer followed here'}
