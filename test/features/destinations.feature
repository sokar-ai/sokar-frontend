Feature: The services a credential can be for, managed from here

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work

  Scenario: the machine's menu opens its destinations
    When I open the menu {'What this machine can be told to do'}
    Then the menu offers {'Destinations — the services a credential can be for'}
    When I choose the menu entry {'Destinations — the services a credential can be for'}
    Then the destinations of the machine are open

  # Where requests go and where the key goes in them: what a person needs to tell two apart.
  Scenario: each destination says where it is and where its key goes
    Given the machine declares the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    When I choose the command {'Destinations — the services a credential can be for'}
    Then it says {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    And it says {'The key goes in the header Authorization, after "Bearer ".'}

  # Nothing is written that the machine did not read back first, exactly as it was typed.
  Scenario: a destination is checked by the machine before it is written
    When I choose the command {'Destinations — the services a credential can be for'}
    And I add the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    Then the destination cannot be written yet
    When I check the destination
    Then it says {'The machine would read it back as https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    And nothing was written to the machine
    When I write the destination
    Then the machine wrote the destination {'weather'}
    And it says {'Written: weather'}

  # What is written is what was checked: typing after the check asks for another.
  Scenario: a destination changed after its check is checked again before it is written
    When I choose the command {'Destinations — the services a credential can be for'}
    And I add the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    And I check the destination
    And I type the destination's address {'https://api.weather.example/v2'}
    Then the destination cannot be written yet

  Scenario: a destination the machine refuses is said in its words, and nothing is written
    When I choose the command {'Destinations — the services a credential can be for'}
    And I add the destination {'weather'} at {'http://api.weather.example'}
    And I check the destination
    Then it says {'must be reached over https'}
    And the destination cannot be written yet
    And nothing was written to the machine

  Scenario: a destination of one's own is removed, and the file it was is named
    Given the machine declares the destination {'weather'} at {'https://api.weather.example/v1'}
    When I choose the command {'Destinations — the services a credential can be for'}
    And I remove the destination {'weather'}
    Then it says {'Removed weather'}
    And it says {'No destination is declared on this machine.'}

  # A package's file is the package's; one of the person's own can only take its place.
  Scenario: a destination a package installed is not removed or changed here
    Given a package declares the destination {'search'} at {'https://api.search.example'}
    When I choose the command {'Destinations — the services a credential can be for'}
    Then the destination {'search'} offers no removal
    And it says {'Put your own in its place'}

  Scenario: one's own destination put in the place of a package's says the package's is not in force
    Given a package declares the destination {'search'} at {'https://api.search.example'}
    When I choose the command {'Destinations — the services a credential can be for'}
    And I put my own in the place of {'search'} at {'https://search.internal.example'}
    Then it says {'Installed by a package, and not in force'}
