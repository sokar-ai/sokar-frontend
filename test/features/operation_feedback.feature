Feature: Running long operations without blocking the frame

  Background:
    Given a backend with work on it
    And the app is running
    And I go to the work
    And I select the project {'checkout'}

  Scenario: the frame stays usable while a long operation runs
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And I close what is open
    And I select the project {'checkout'}
    Then the work {'sokar-checkout-shell'} is listed
    And the operation is still running

  Scenario: output goes to the operation and disturbs nothing else
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation prints {'Building the image'}
    Then the operation shows {'Building the image'}
    When I close what is open
    Then {'Building the image'} is nowhere on the frame

  Scenario: an operation can be left and watched again without stopping it
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation prints {'step one'}
    And I close what is open
    And the operation prints {'step two'}
    And I show what this session has run
    And I open the last operation
    Then the operation shows {'step one'}
    And the operation shows {'step two'}
    And the operation is still running

  Scenario: everything this session ran is listed afterwards with its outcome
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation finishes
    And I close what is open
    And I show what this session has run
    Then the record shows {'would open'}
    And the record shows {'Finished.'}

  Scenario: failure is reported where success would have been, with the output that explains it
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation prints {'could not read project.yml'}
    And the operation fails
    And I close what is open
    And I show what this session has run
    Then the record shows {'exited with code 1'}
    And the record marks it as failed
    When I open the last operation
    Then the operation shows {'could not read project.yml'}

  Scenario: a run stopped by its own time limit is not read as a run that went wrong
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation prints {'agent: editing lib/money.dart'}
    And the operation runs out of time
    And I close what is open
    And I show what this session has run
    Then the record shows {'ran out of the time it was given'}
    When I open the last operation
    Then the operation shows {'agent: editing lib/money.dart'}

  Scenario: a run refused before it began says nothing was created, not that it failed
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the run is refused before it begins
    And I close what is open
    And I show what this session has run
    Then the record shows {'Nothing ran, and nothing was created'}

  # Somebody who closed the view before it failed has not seen it, and nothing else would say so.
  Scenario: a failure nobody watched waits under what needs a person until it is opened
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation prints {'could not read project.yml'}
    And I close what is open
    And the operation fails
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then a failed operation waits saying {'would open'}
    And the count of what needs a person is {'1 need you'}
    When I open the failed operation from what needs a person
    Then the operation shows {'could not read project.yml'}
    When I close what is open
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then no failed operation waits
    And the count of what needs a person is {'nothing needs you'}

  Scenario: a failure watched as it happened does not wait
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation fails
    And I close what is open
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then no failed operation waits

  Scenario: an operation that finished never waits
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And I close what is open
    And the operation finishes
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then no failed operation waits

  Scenario: a failure opened from the session record no longer waits
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And I close what is open
    And the operation fails
    And I show what this session has run
    And I open the last operation
    And I close what is open
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then no failed operation waits

  # What ran is kept in a file, so closing the window does not lose it.
  Scenario: what was run is listed again after a restart, marked as earlier
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And the operation finishes
    And I close what is open
    And the app is restarted
    And I show what this session has run
    Then the record shows {'would open'}
    And the record shows {'earlier'}

  Scenario: a failure nobody opened still waits after a restart
    When I choose the command {'Show what this project would open, creating nothing'}
    And I close what is open
    And the operation fails
    And the app is restarted
    And I go to what needs a person
    Then a failed operation waits saying {'would open'}

  Scenario: the record says where it is kept
    When I show what this session has run
    Then the record shows {'Kept for 30 days in'}

  Scenario: the file of what was run is opened from the finder
    When I choose the command {'Open the file of everything that was run'}
    Then the file of what was run was opened
