# Design

How this interface is built. The requirements say what must be true for a person using it; this
says what it is made of. One section per decision, each with the reason it was taken — a decision
without one gets re-argued every time somebody new reads it.

## Flutter

- **Language:** Dart 3.13, Flutter 3.47 stable. Pinned in `pubspec.yaml` once the app exists;
  until then these are what the decisions below were taken against.
- **UI:** Flutter, one codebase for desktop and tablet. **Linux desktop is the only target that
  works today** — the backend is a unix socket, so a client has to be able to open one, and a
  phone cannot without a tunnel it has no way to raise. Phone is not designed out; it is simply
  not reachable until there is a way for a device without a shell to get
  a socket, and the layouts do not assume it never will.
- **Contract:** the Sokar backend and its API contract — the varlink interface
  `org.fuin.sokar.Tasks1`, over one unix socket. **No REST, no HTTP, no shared code with the
  backend at all**: the only thing crossing the boundary is the IDL, which the daemon serves
  from itself. See [Backend API](Backend-API.md) before writing a call.
- **Client:** hand-written, in one package, against the contract. There is no varlink code
  generator for Dart and the protocol is small enough — a socket, JSON objects, a NUL between
  them — that generating it would be more machinery than it saves. Whether that stays true once
  every method has a typed request and reply is the open question below.
- **Auth:** **none, and that is the design.** The socket is owner-only, so the filesystem decides
  who may connect and there is nothing to log in to. A remote backend is an SSH forward, so its
  authentication is SSH's. A design that needs a token, a session or a login screen means
  something has gone wrong upstream of it.
- **Build:** **Maven drives Flutter here.** A `pom.xml` in this repository calls `flutter` through
  `exec-maven-plugin` — `pub get` in `generate-sources`, analyze and the tests in theirs,
  `flutter build` in `package` — with a profile keyed on `env.FLUTTER_ROOT`, so a machine without
  Flutter still builds.

  **What it costs is a JDK.** The interface builds, tests and releases on its own, and needs a JDK
  to do it, for one reason: an end-to-end test that drives this interface against a real machine
  has to lease one, and leasing is `org.fuin.sokar.machines`, which is Java. With Maven here it is
  a library call; without it, a downloaded jar and a command.

  **This repository is still not in the backend's reactor.** It resolves `sokar-machines` as a
  published artifact like any other dependency. The split that matters — that the interface
  releases on its own schedule, against a published contract rather than a checkout of the
  backend — is unchanged. What changed is the tool that runs the build, not who owns it.
- **Test:** `flutter test`, and **`dart analyze` at "No issues found!"**, failing the build on any
  finding. It is `dart analyze`, not `flutter analyze`, which rewrites `analysis_options.yaml` with
  an exclude block that silences findings instead of fixing them.

## The terminal, and the only dependency there is

A session inside running work needs two things this codebase did not have: something that
understands escape sequences, and a pseudoterminal. They were decided separately and the answers
are different.

- **`xterm` from pub.dev draws it, and it is the first runtime dependency here.** Everything else
  is hand-written against a contract — the varlink client included, because that protocol is a
  socket, JSON and a NUL. A VT emulator is where that argument stops holding: cursor motion, an
  alternate screen, scroll regions, colour, wide characters and reflow are not a small protocol,
  and getting one subtly wrong is the failure the requirement was about — colours work, and then
  `Ctrl-C` ends the wrong thing. It is pure Dart, so it changes nothing about the package.
- **The pty is ours, written with `dart:ffi`.** The usual companion, `flutter_pty`, is a native
  plugin, and a native plugin is another `.so` in the bundle. Every `.so` in the bundle goes
  through `dpkg-shlibdeps` and the rpm scanner and comes out as a package dependency, which is
  the chain the packaging requirement was about — met and retired — and the most delicate part of shipping this.
  `dart:ffi` is in the SDK and costs the packaging nothing.
- **Nothing forks.** The obvious shape is `forkpty` and then `exec` in the child — and the child
  returns into the Dart runtime, in a process whose other threads no longer exist. `posix_spawn`
  with `POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID` does both inside libc, and the child takes the terminal by opening it
  as a session leader, so no Dart code ever runs in a forked process.
- **A blocking `read` needs somewhere to block.** `dart:io` cannot wrap a descriptor it did not
  create, so an isolate sits in `read(2)` and posts what it gets. It reaps the child too, so a
  session that ends leaves no zombie.
- **The terminal holds the frame's keyboard for what is open**, rather than the frame holding it.
  Every other thing that opens over the frame is read rather than typed into, so the frame keeping
  the keyboard costs them nothing; a terminal is the opposite. With the frame holding it `Escape`
  closed the pane and never reached the far end, which would have made `vim` unusable inside a
  session.
- **What cannot be faked is tested against the kernel.** `test/app/pty_test.dart` runs `stty size`
  in a pty and reads the answer back, which proves the controlling terminal and the window size in
  one line. Everything above the byte channel is proven through a seam, on the fake clock, like
  the rest of the interface.

## Testing

Tests are written as Gherkin `.feature` files and run as ordinary Flutter widget tests, via
**[`bdd_widget_test`](https://pub.dev/packages/bdd_widget_test)**, which generates the tests from
the features.

- **Why that one, measured rather than assumed.** It is the only live option in this space:
  `sdk: ^3.7.0`, 63k downloads, 181 likes — against `flutter_gherkin` (declares `sdk: <3.0.0`,
  changelog ends May 2021, pins `gherkin ^2.0.2` while that is at 3.1.0, drags in the legacy
  `flutter_driver` stack), the `gherkin` package itself (`sdk: <3.0.0`, changelog ends July
  2022), and `bdd_flutter` (41 downloads).
- **It generates real tests, which is the whole point.** A feature becomes a `group` and each
  scenario a `testWidgets`. Every other Gherkin option for Dart is a *parallel runner* with its
  own reporters — `flutter_gherkin` contains no `testWidgets` and no `group` anywhere — so its
  scenarios never become `package:test` events, never reach JUnit XML, and never appear
  individually on a build server. That single fact decided this.
- **Results on the build server:** `tool/test_report.dart` reads `flutter test --machine` once and
  writes the HTML page, JUnit XML grouped by feature, a table on the run's summary page, and an
  `::error` on the line of each failing scenario. Why each is shaped that way is in
  [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/sokar-ai/sokar-frontend/blob/main/AGENTS.md), under *What the build reports*.
- **The `Feature` line says what the file tests**, in one short sentence of 70 characters at most.
  It is the group name in every report, so a reworded scenario never moves a row.
- **Steps are shared by name.** `Given the app is running` resolves to
  `test/features/step/the_app_is_running.dart` across every feature that uses it, and the generator
  scaffolds the file the first time. So step wording *is* the API: phrase a step the way you
  want to reuse it, and vary the data rather than the sentence.
- **Names are checked, not maintained.** `test/features_named_test.dart` holds every `Feature`
  line to one short sentence, unique, with no requirement id in it, and `test/docs_test.dart`
  holds these documents to files that exist. A table nobody checks is a table that lies.

A green row is not completeness: a feature with one shallow scenario shows as green as one
with twelve. Only reading the scenarios fixes that, and no framework changes it.

**Generated tests are committed**, and the build runs `build_runner` and fails on a diff. Left
out, a build that did not generate them would find no tests and report green; committed and
checked, they cannot drift or silently vanish.

### How it is laid out, as measured

- **`test/features/*.feature`**, with step definitions in **`test/features/step/`** — beside the
  feature, not in `test/step/`. The generator scaffolds a stub there the first time it meets a
  step, referencing `MyApp`; replace it. A stub left unreplaced fails to compile, which is the
  right way round.
- **Generated tests land beside their feature** as `<name>_test.dart`.
- `dart run build_runner build` after adding or editing a feature. Its
  `--delete-conflicting-outputs` flag has been removed and is silently ignored.
- `avoid_print` is disabled per-file in `tool/contract.dart`: it is a command-line tool and
  printing is its output. That is the only lint exception, and it is stated in the file.

## The mock backend

A mock daemon — a small Dart program binding a real unix socket and speaking real varlink. The
app's own client runs against it unchanged, because the socket path is the only thing that
differs. That is the same property that makes a remote backend work, so the mock costs nothing
extra to reach.

**It is permanent, not scaffolding until the backend is ready.** It produces states a real
daemon cannot be made to produce on demand, and those are the hard requirements:

- `MethodNotFound`, to prove per-feature degradation against an older backend. A real daemon
  always has all its methods, so this rule is otherwise unenforceable.
- An unrecognized `Outcome` value, to prove the tolerance rule. A real daemon only ever sends
  values it knows — and a generated Dart enum with no fallback case is exactly how this breaks.
- `GetInfo` advertising `Tasks2`, to prove the client picks the highest name it understands.
- A stream cut mid-flight, for the requirement that tunnel loss reads as disconnection and never
  as an empty fleet.
- `HOLDS_WORK` on demand, without contriving a task that genuinely holds unpushed commits.
- A four-minute image build, and a clearance prompt with a live deadline.

It also means the test suite needs no podman, no containers and no Linux host with a runtime —
so it runs on any hosted runner.

- **Scenarios are named for the situation, not the requirement** — `task-holds-unpushed-work`,
  not `f09-case-2`. A finished requirement is deleted; the situation and the test guarding it
  outlive it.
- **Events are driven by the test, never by wall clock.** Otherwise stream tests are flaky, and
  flaky tests get deleted.
- **Drift is caught by one CI job with a real daemon**: install the `sokar` package, start
  `sokard`, compare the mock's method and field set against `GetInterfaceDescription`. The mock
  proves the client handles what it is sent; that job proves the contract is what we think it is.
  Neither substitutes for the other, and a drifted mock is worse than no mock.
- **Watch the socket path length.** Unix paths are limited to about 108 bytes on Linux and
  temporary directories in test harnesses get long enough to hit it.

## Packaging

Delivered as a `.deb` and an `.rpm`, from the same repository as the `sokar` package —
The packaging requirement is met and retired; this is what it is made of.

- **Output:** `flutter build linux --release` produces a bundle directory — the binary,
  `lib/libapp.so`, `lib/libflutter_linux_gtk.so`, `data/`. Measured at 22 MB and 11 s. The
  package installs that directory, a launcher on the path, a `.desktop` entry and an icon.
- **Dependencies:** derived, never listed. The shipped `.so` resolves the system GTK3 stack, and
  `dpkg-shlibdeps` and rpm's ELF scanner both work that out themselves. A hand-written list is a
  list that goes stale between Flutter releases.
- **Tool:** [nfpm](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/) — one static binary, one YAML, both formats.
  **Not `rpm-maven-plugin` and jdeb**, which is what the backend uses: those plugins need
  `rpmbuild` on a Debian runner, where nfpm writes both formats from one binary. What matches the
  rest of Sokar is the package a person installs, not the tool that wrote it; that Maven runs the
  build here is no reason to change it.
- **Relationship to the backend:** `Recommends: sokar`, not `Depends:`. An interface talking to
  a remote daemon over SSH is useful with no local backend, and a hard dependency would be wrong
  for that.
- **Where it is published:** into the same Artifactory repository as `sokar` and the agent
  packages. A dependency between packages does not resolve when they are split across configured
  sources — this is recorded in the backend's own notes and applies here unchanged.
- **Build machine:** Ubuntu, never Fedora, because the bundle links glibc dynamically — the
  backend's own rule. Flutter adds one the CLI never had: the bundle links the GTK3 stack too,
  so the build machine's GTK is the oldest GTK the package can run against, and the build runs on
  the oldest distribution that must be supported.
- **Architecture:** Flutter has no cross-compile for Linux desktop. Every architecture shipped
  needs a builder of that architecture.

### Where it lives

**`lib/` at the root, one package named `sokar_frontend`**, organization `org.fuin`, Linux the only
enabled platform. A `packages/` split pays for itself only once something is shared, and nothing
is; a second consumer of the client code is what would change that.
